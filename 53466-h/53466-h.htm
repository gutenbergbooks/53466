<p class="chaptitle">"BUDDHA'S EYE."</p>


<p>"It's three long and weary hours, pard, before the
boat for New York ties up at the landing. You don't
want to cool your heels in the hotel, do you, while we're
waiting? How about doing something to fill in the
time?"</p>

<p>It was about seven o'clock in the evening, and Motor
Matt and his cowboy chum, Joe McGlory, were sitting
on the porch of their hotel in Catskill-on-the-Hudson.
The hotel was on an elevation, and the boys could look
out over the river and see the lights of steamers,
tugs, motor boats, and other craft gliding up and down
in a glittering maze.</p>

<p>Matt had been looking down at the river lights, and
dreaming. He aroused himself with a start at the sound
of his chum's voice.</p>

<p>"What would you suggest, Joe?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Let's take in the moving-picture shows. Say, they're
the greatest thing for a nickel that I ever saw. Some
yap gets into trouble, and then ladies and gents, and
workmen, and clerks, and nurses with baby cabs take
after the poor duffer, and there's a high old time for
all hands. I'm plumb hungry for excitement, Matt.
This town has become mighty tame since we parted
company with Tsan Ti."</p>

<p>"If you think the moving-picture shows will furnish
what you need in the excitement line, Joe, we'll go out
and take them in."</p>

<p>Matt got up with a laugh, and he and McGlory left
the hotel, and laid a course for the main street of the
town. At the first nickel theatre they came to, they gave
up a dime, and moved into the darkened room. An illustrated
song was in the lantern, and a young man with
a husky voice was singing something about a "stingy
moon."</p>

<p>The motor boys stumbled around in the dark, and McGlory
tried to slip into a seat that was already occupied.
A stifled scream made him aware of his mistake, and
he tumbled all over himself to get somewhere else.</p>

<p>"Speak to me about that!" he whispered to Matt,
with a choppy chuckle. "That's the trouble with these
moving-picture honkatonks when you come in after the
lights are out. Oh, bother that stingy moon! I wish the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
chap with the raw voice would cut it out, and let the
rest of the show get to climbing over the screen."</p>

<p>"Don't be so impatient, old chap," returned Matt.
"You've got to have something happening to you about
once every fifteen minutes, or you get so nervous you
can't sit still. In that respect, you're a lot like Dick Ferral,
a sailor chum I cruised with a while ago. Now&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sh-h-h!" interrupted the cowboy. "The piano has
had enough of the moon, and now here comes the first
moving picture."</p>

<p>White letters quivered on the screen. "Buddha's
Eye" was the title of the series of pictures about to be
shown. McGlory gulped excitedly, and Matt stared.
The motor boys had just finished a wild entanglement
with a great ruby called the "Eye of Buddha," and this,
the first picture in the first theatre that claimed them, reminded
them, with something like a shock, of recent experiences.</p>

<p>"Sufferin' sparks!" muttered McGlory. "What's the
difference between 'Buddha's Eye' and the 'Eye of Buddha,'
Matt?"</p>

<p>"No difference, Joe," answered Matt. "This is just a
coincidence, that's all."</p>

<p>The interior of a Buddhist temple was thrown on the
screen. The views were colored, and priests in gray
and yellow robes could be seen moving back and forth
and prostrating themselves before a huge gilt idol. The
idol was of a "sitting Buddha" and must have measured
full twenty feet from the temple floor to the top of the
head.</p>

<p>With a flash, the interior of the temple gave way to
an enlarged view of the idol's head. The head had but
one eye, placed in the centre of the forehead&mdash;a huge
ruby, which glowed like a splash of warm blood.</p>

<p>"The Honam joss house, in the suburbs of Canton!"
whispered McGlory excitedly. "If it ain't, I'm a Piute!"</p>

<p>Motor Matt kept silence, wondering.</p>

<p>The boys were next afforded a view of two men, plotting
aboard a sampan near the island of Honam. One
was tall and had a dark face and sinister eyes. He wore
a solar hat with a pugree. The other had on sailor
clothes, had a fringe of mutton-chop whiskers about his
jaws and a green patch over his right eye. McGlory
grabbed Matt's arm in a convulsive grip.</p>

<p>"What do you think of that?" demanded the cowboy,
in a husky whisper. "The tinhorn in the sun hat is
Grattan, and the webfoot is Bunce. Am I in a trance, or
what?"</p>

<p>"Watch!" returned Matt, fully as mystified as was his
chum.</p>

<p>The next picture was labeled, "The Egyptian Balls&mdash;view
of excavations at Karnak, on the Upper Nile."</p>

<p>Ponderous ruins were brought into view, showing
Egyptian fellahs digging in a subterranean chamber. An
urn was lifted up and uncovered. From this urn the
wondering workmen removed a number of crystalline
spheres. One of the spheres dropped from an awkward
hand, crashed to fragments on the floor of the chamber,
and instantly all the workmen staggered, flung their
hands to their faces, and fell sprawling, lying on the
stones prone and silent.</p>

<p>Two men stole in upon them, covered with flowing
Arab robes, and their faces masked in white. Swiftly
they gathered up some of the balls, and the camera followed
them as they left the chamber and stood under the
broken columns of the ancient temple of Karnak. The
robes were flung away, and the masks removed. Grattan
and Bunce, the sampan plotters, stood revealed.</p>

<p>"I've got the blind staggers, I reckon!" mumbled McGlory,
rubbing his eyes. "It was in Egypt Grattan got
his dope balls&mdash;the glass spheres filled with the knock-out
fumes. This&mdash;this&mdash;sufferin' brain twisters! It's
more'n I can savvy."</p>

<p>After Grattan and Bunce had gone through a pantomime
expressive of their wild delight on securing the
balls, the films entered into another series, entitled, "The
Theft of the Great Ruby from the Honam Joss House,
near Canton, China."</p>

<p>The walls outside the temple were shown, and an
avenue bordered with banyan trees, with rooks flapping
among the branches. Grattan and Bunce were seen making
their way along the avenue, entering the temple court,
and coming into the chamber which had been flashed on
the screen at the beginning.</p>

<p>Here was the huge idol again, and the yellow-robed
priests moving about. For a space, Grattan and Bunce
stood and gazed; then, suddenly, Grattan pulled a hand
from his coat, held one of the glass balls over his head
for a space, then sent it crashing among the priests. The
priests started up in amazement, recovered their wits,
and rushed toward the foreign devils. But the priests
were suddenly stricken before Grattan and Bunce could
be roughly dealt with.</p>

<p>White masks had been pushed over the faces of the
two plotters, and the pair watched while the priests,
overcome by the paralyzing, sense-destroying fumes from
the broken balls, reeled to the temple floor, and lay there
in inert heaps. The masks protected Grattan and Bunce
from the baneful influence of the balls.</p>

<p>As soon as the priests were stretched silent upon the
floor, Grattan unwound a ladder of silk from about his
waist. One end of the ladder was weighted with a bit
of lead, and this end was thrown over the idol's head.
Thereupon, Grattan mounted the ladder, and dug out the
ruby with a knife. Upon descending, he and Bunce went
through another pantomime, suggesting their joy over
the success of their shameless work, and then passed
quickly from the court, stuffing their white masks into
their pockets as they went.</p>

<p>The next scene was in the room of a house in the foreign
quarter, on the sea wall, called Shameen. Grattan
was secreting the ruby in the head of a buckthorn cane.
Barely was the secreting done, when a fat mandarin burst
in on them with a number of armed coolies at his heels.</p>

<p>The mandarin seemed to be accusing Grattan. Grattan
could be seen to shake his head protestingly. Then Grattan
and Bunce were searched thoroughly, and the room
ransacked. In the utmost chagrin, the mandarin and his
coolies left, without having been able to discover anything.
A few minutes later, the thieves took their triumphant
departure, Grattan exultantly waving the buckthorn
stick.</p>

<p>Scarcely breathing, and with staring eyes, the motor
boys continued to watch the pictures as they raced over
the white screen. What wonder work was this? From
Grattan's own lips Matt had heard of the robbery at
the Honam joss house, in which Grattan had played
such an important part. So far, the pictures had shown
it substantially as the details had come from Grattan;
there were a few minor differences, but they were insignificant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span></p>

<p>From this point, however, Grattan's story and the
story as told by the pictures were at variance.</p>

<p>The thieves got into a couple of sedan chairs, each
chair carried by four coolies. Apparently, Grattan and
Bunce were on their way to the river to embark for
other shores. When near the landing, one of the poles
supporting the chair in which Grattan was riding broke.
The chair fell, the bamboo door burst open, and Grattan
tumbled out. One of the coolies picked up the buckthorn
cane, and another the sun hat with the pugree. Grattan,
in anger, knocked down the coolie who had picked up his
hat. The other, coming to his countryman's aid, struck
at Grattan with the head of the cane. Grattan dropped
to his knees. The cane passed over his head, and the
force the coolie had put into the blow carried the stick
out of his hand, and sent it smashing against the side
of a "go-down."</p>

<p>The head of the cane was broken, and the great ruby
rolled over the earth out of the débris, and lay gleaming
in the sun under the eyes of the astounded coolies. Then,
with the inexplicable timeliness so prevalent in motion
pictures, the fat mandarin and his coolies came upon the
scene, the mandarin gathering in "Buddha's Eye" with
extravagant expressions of joy, and Grattan and Bunce
writhing desperately in the hands of the chair men and
the mandarin's guard.</p>

<p>That was all. The scenes to follow were of a humorous
order, and probably had to do with some unfortunate
getting into trouble and leading a varied assortment of
people a gay chase, but McGlory had lost interest in the
show. So had Matt.</p>

<p>As by a common impulse, the boys got up and groped
their bewildered way out of the room and into the street.
They were dazed, thunderstruck, and hardly knew what
to think.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">THE GREEN PATCH.</p>


<p>Distracted by their mental speculations, the motor boys
presently found themselves back on the porch of their
hotel, occupying the same chairs they had left a little
while before. Once more Matt was looking down on the
river lights, coming and going across the broad stream
like so many fireflies.</p>

<p>"Am I locoed, I wonder?" inquired McGlory, as though
speaking to himself. "Did I see that moving picture, with
Grattan and Bunce in it and stealing the 'Eye of Buddha,'
or didn't I?"</p>

<p>"You saw the picture, Joe," returned Matt, "and so
did I."</p>

<p>"I reckon I did; and jumpin' tarantulas, how it got on
my nerves! But how does it happen that the picture is
being shown like it is? Grattan told you, Matt, just how
the ruby was stolen from the Honam joss house by himself
and Bunce; he told you how he went to Egypt after
the glass balls that were more than two thousand years
old, and had been dug up at Karnak. He didn't get the
balls from Karnak just exactly in the way the picture
shows it, but he did steal the ruby in exactly the same
fashion those films brought the tinhorn trick under our
eyes. Not only that, but Grattan hid the ruby in the head
of his cane. Right up to that point the whole game is a
dead ringer for the yarn Grattan batted up to you. The
rest of the pictures are pure fake. It was you who helped
recover 'Buddha's Eye,' and it happened right here in the
Catskill Mountains, near the village of Purling, and not in
China. But it was the smashing of the head of the cane
that revealed the ruby."<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_A_1" id="Footnote_A_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_1"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> The thrilling adventures of the motor boys in recovering the
Eye of Buddha were set forth in No. 30, Motor Stories.</p></div>

<p>"We know," said Matt, his mind recovering from the
shock occasioned by the strange series of pictures so suddenly
sprung upon him and McGlory, "we know, pard,
that Grattan was in the motion-picture business at the
time he conceived the idea of stealing the ruby. He was
traveling all over the world with his camera apparatus.
Probably his line of work has something to do with his
putting the robbery into the form we have just seen it."</p>

<p>"But why should Grattan want to publish his criminal
work all over the country in moving pictures? And he
put himself into the pictures, too&mdash;and that old sea dog,
Bunce."</p>

<p>"That part of it is too many for me, Joe," answered
Matt. "However, I can't see as the moving pictures of
the robbery cut much figure now. The mandarin, Tsan
Ti, has recovered the ruby, and is on his way to San
Francisco to take ship for China. Grattan and Bunce
made their escape, and are probably getting out of the
country, or into parts unknown, as rapidly as they can.
So far as we are concerned, the incident is closed. But
it was certainly a startler to come face to face with a set
of pictures like those&mdash;and so unexpectedly."</p>

<p>"First nickelodeon we struck, and the first picture
shoved through the lantern," muttered the cowboy.</p>

<p>"Are you positive, Joe," went on Matt, "that the two
thieves who figured in the picture were really Grattan and
Bunce?"</p>

<p>"It's a cinch!" declared McGlory. "There can't be any
mistake. I never saw a clearer set of pictures, and I'd
know Grattan and Bunce anywhere&mdash;could pick 'em out
of a thousand."</p>

<p>"That's the way it looked to me, and yet there's one
point I can't understand. It's a point that doesn't agree
with your assertion that Bunce was really in the picture."</p>

<p>"What point is that?"</p>

<p>"Why, it has to do with the green patch Bunce wears
over his eye."</p>

<p>"The patch was in the picture, all right."</p>

<p>"Sure it was! But which of Bunce's eyes did it
cover?"</p>

<p>"The right eye!"</p>

<p>"Exactly! The green patch was over Bunce's right
eye, in the picture of the robbery, which we just saw; but
when we had our several encounters with Bunce, a few
days ago, the patch was over the mariner's left eye."</p>

<p>McGlory straightened up in his chair and stared at his
chum through the electric light that shone over them
from the porch ceiling.</p>

<p>"Glory to glory and all hands round!" he exclaimed.
"You're right, pard. When we were trotting that heat
with Bunce, here in the Catskills, it was his left eye that
was gone. Now, in the picture, it's his right eye. How
do you explain that?"</p>

<p>"The explanation seems easy enough," answered Matt.
"Bunce must have two good eyes, and he simply covers
up one for the purpose of disguise. Either that, or else
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>some one represented him when the moving pictures were
taken, and got the patch over the wrong eye."</p>

<p>"What good is a green patch as a disguise, anyway?"
demanded McGlory.</p>

<p>"Give it up. The difference in the position of the patch
merely led me to infer that Bunce might not have really
been in that moving picture. And if Bunce wasn't in it,
then it's possible that Grattan wasn't in it, either. Two
men might have been made up to represent the two
thieves. I can't think it possible that Grattan and Bunce,
as you said a moment ago, should want to publish their
crime throughout the country by means of these moving
pictures. The films are rented everywhere, and travel
from place to place."</p>

<p>McGlory heaved a long breath.</p>

<p>"Well, anyhow, I don't want to bother myself any more
with the Eye of Buddha," said he. "It's a hoodoo, and I
never went through such a lot of close shaves, or such a
series of rapid-fire events, as when we were helping Tsan
Ti, the mandarin, recover the ruby. Let's forget about it.
We can't understand how those pictures came to be
shown, and we're completely at sea regarding the green
patch. But it's nothing to us, any more. We're for New
York by the night boat, and then it'll be 'Up the river or
down the bay, over to Coney or Rockaway' for the motor
boys. Sufferin' cat naps! A spell of pleasure in the metro-polus
is all that brought me East with you, anyhow.
It's us for the big town, and with you along to see that
no one sells me a gold brick, I reckon I'll be able to pan
out a good time."</p>

<p>The prospect of a week or two in New York, with a
little rest and a little motoring, was also appealing powerfully
to Matt. He had not been in the big town for
some time, and he longed to renew his acquaintance with
its many "sights" and experiences.</p>

<p>"We'll be there in the morning, Joe," Matt answered.
"As you say, we need not bother our heads any longer
about the Eye of Buddha, or Grattan, or Bunce, or Tsan
Ti. We'll take our toll of enjoyment out of Manhattan
Isle, and we'll forget there ever was such a thing as the
big ruby."</p>

<p>"You don't intend to think of business at all while
you're there, eh?"</p>

<p>"No. We'll just knock around for a couple of weeks
and enjoy ourselves. Of course we'll be more or less
among the motors&mdash;I couldn't be happy myself if we
weren't&mdash;and then, when we've had enough of that, I
want to take a run up to my old home in the Berkshire
Hills."</p>

<p>Great Barrington had been very much in Motor Matt's
mind for several weeks. He felt a desire to go back to
the old place, and revisit the scenes of his earlier life.
There was a mystery concerning his parents which had
never been solved. He did not have any idea that a
return to Great Barrington would settle that problem,
but, nevertheless, it had something to do with luring him
in the direction of the Berkshires.</p>

<p>"Speak to me about that!" murmured McGlory.
"You've always been a good deal of a riddle to me, pard.
You've never let out much about your early life, and I
come from a country where it's a signal for fireworks if
you press a man too closely about his past, so I've just
taken you as I picked you up in 'Frisco, and let it go at
that. But there are a few things I'd like to know, just the
same."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you about them sometime, Joe," Matt answered.
"Just now, though, I'm not in the mood. When
we're ready to start for the Berkshires&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He paused. The night clerk of the hotel had come out
on the porch and was standing at his elbow, a small
package in his hand.</p>

<p>"Motor Matt," said he, in a voice of concern, "here's
something that came for you by express, about five-thirty
in the afternoon. It's been lying in the safe ever since.
The day clerk couldn't find you, when the package came,
so he receipted for it. He didn't tell me anything about
it, when I went on duty, and he just happened to remember
and to telephone down from his room. I'm sorry
about the delay."</p>

<p>"We're taking the ten-o'clock boat for New York,"
spoke up McGlory. "It would have been a nice layout if
we'd got away and left that package behind."</p>

<p>"I'm mighty sorry, but it's not my fault."</p>

<p>"Well," answered Matt, taking the package, "no great
harm has been done. It's an hour and a half, yet, before
the New York boat gets here, and I have the package."</p>

<p>The clerk went back into the hotel and Matt examined
the package under the light.</p>

<p>"What do you reckon it is, pard?" queried McGlory
curiously.</p>

<p>"You can give as good a guess as I can, Joe," Matt
answered. "I'm not expecting anybody to send me anything.
It's addressed plainly enough to Motor Matt,
Catskill, New York, in care of this hotel."</p>

<p>"And covered with red sealing wax," added McGlory.
"Rip off the cover and let's see what's on the inside.
Sufferin' tenterhooks! Haven't you got any curiosity?"</p>

<p>Matt cut the cord that bound the package and took off
the wrapper. A small wooden box was disclosed, bound
with another cord.</p>

<p>The box was opened, and seemed to be filled with cotton
wadding. Resting the box on his knees, Matt proceeded
to remove the wadding. Then he fell back in his
chair with an astounded exclamation.</p>

<p>A round object, glimmering in the rays of the electric
light like a splash of blood against the cotton, lay under
the amazed eyes of the motor boys.</p>

<p>"Buddha's Eye!" whispered McGlory.</p>

<p>Around the end of the veranda, in the wavering
shadows, a face had pushed itself above the veranda
railing&mdash;a face topped with a sailor cap and fringed with
"mutton-chop" whiskers&mdash;a face with a green patch over
one eye.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">MOTOR MATT&mdash;TRUSTEE.</p>


<p>Matt and McGlory had seen the Eye of Buddha, and
they were not slow in recognizing it. But the bewildering
events of the evening were crowned by this arrival
of the ruby, by express, consigned to Motor Matt. By
all the laws of reasoning and logic, the gem, worth a
king's ransom, should at that moment have been in the
possession of Tsan Ti, en route to the Flowery Kingdom.</p>

<p>"Oh, tell&mdash;me&mdash;about this!" stuttered McGlory.</p>

<p>Matt picked the ruby up in his fingers and held it in
the palm of his hand. Apparently he was loath to credit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
the evidence of his senses. From every angle he surveyed
the glittering gem.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't this rattle you?" he murmured, peering at
his chum.</p>

<p>"Rattle me!" exploded McGlory. "Why, pard, it leaves
me high and dry&mdash;stranded&mdash;gasping like a fish. Tsan
Ti must be locoed! At last accounts, he was in a flutter
to get that ruby back to the Honam joss house and replace
it in the idol's head, where it belongs. What came
over the mandarin to box it up and ship it to you? I'm
fair dazed, and no mistake. This cuts the ground right
out from under me."</p>

<p>Matt, with a hasty look around, dropped the ruby into
his pocket; then he pulled out some more of the wadding
and discovered, in the bottom of the box, a folded sheet
of white paper.</p>

<p>"Here's a letter," said he. "This will explain why
the ruby was sent to me, I guess."</p>

<p>"What good's an explanation?" grunted the cowboy.
"I wouldn't be tangled up with that thing for a mint of
money. Sufferin' centipedes! It's a regular hoodoo, and
hands a fellow a hard-luck knock every time he turns
around. What's in the letter, anyway? If it's from
Tsan Ti, I'll bet his paper talk is heavy with big words
and all kinds of Class A 'con' lingo. Read it, do. I can't
tell how nervous you make me hanging fire."</p>

<p>"It's from Tsan Ti, all right," said Matt, "and is dated
New York."</p>

<p>"New York! Why, he was hitting nothing but high
places in the direction of 'Frisco, when he left here. How,
in the name of all his ten thousand demons of misfortune,
does he happen to be in New York?"</p>

<p>"Listen," answered Matt, and began to read.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"'Esteemed and illustrious youth, whose never-to-be-forgotten
services to me shine like letters of gold on a
tablet of silver: Behold&mdash;&mdash;'"</p></blockquote>

<p>"Oh, the gush!" growled McGlory.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"'Behold,'" continued Matt, "'I send you the Eye of
Buddha, the priceless jewel which belongs in the temple
of Hai-chwang-sze, in my beloved Canton. You ask,
of your perplexity, why is the jewel sent to you? and I
reply, for the security's sake. Upon my trail comes Grattan,
of the evil heart, weaving his plans for recovering
the costly gem. I fear to keep it about me, and so I send
to you asking that you remain with it in the Catskill
Mountains until such time as I may come to you and
receive it from your hands. This will be when the scoundrel
Grattan is safely beheaded, or in prison, and clear of
my way for all time. I turn to you of my perfect trust,
and I adjure you, by the five hundred gods, not to let the
ruby get for one moment out of your possession. Leave
it nowhere, keep it by you always, either sleeping or
walking, and deliver it to no one except to me, who, at
the right time, will come and request it of you in my own
person. Will it be an insult to offer you one thousand
silver dollars and expense money for consummating this
task? I commend you to the good graces of the supernal
ones whose years are ten thousand times ten thousand!</p>

<p class="sig">
"'<span class="smcap">Tsan Ti</span>, of the Red Button.'"<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>The reading finished, McGlory eased himself of a sputtering
groan.</p>

<p>"Loaded up!" he exclaimed. "You and I, pard, just at
the time we thought we were rid of Tsan Ti and
Buddha's Eye for good, find the thing shouldered onto us
again, and trouble staring us in the face! Why didn't
the mandarin deposit the ruby in some bank, or safe-deposit
vault? Better still, if Grattan was on his trail,
why didn't he have the express company take it to San
Francisco for him instead of sending it to you, at Catskill?
He knows less, that Tsan Ti, than any other
heathen on top of earth. In order to keep himself out
of trouble he hands us the Eye of Buddha, and switches
the responsibility to us. Wouldn't that rattle your spurs?"</p>

<p>McGlory was profoundly disgusted.</p>

<p>"I reckon," he went on, "that this sidetracks us, eh?
The big town is cut out of our reckoning until the mandarin
shows up and claims the ruby. He may do that
to-morrow, or next week, or next month&mdash;and, meanwhile,
here we are, kicking our heels in this humdrum,
back-number, two-by-twice town on the Hudson! Say,
pard, I'd like to fight&mdash;and I'd just as soon take a fall
out of that pesky mandarin as any one else."</p>

<p>"He offers us a thousand dollars and expenses," said
Matt. "Tsan Ti wants to do the right thing, Joe."</p>

<p>"A million dollars and expenses won't pay us for hanging
onto that ruby. It's a hoodoo, and you know that as
well as I do, pard. We can expect things to happen right
from this minute. Say, put it somewhere where it'll be
safe! Put it in the hotel safe, or in a bank, or any place.
Pass the risk along."</p>

<p>"Tsan Ti expressly stipulates that I am to keep the ruby
about me," demurred Matt.</p>

<p>"What of that?" snorted McGlory. "Are you working
for Tsan Ti? Are you bound to do what he tells you to?
What business is it of his if we choose to show a little
sense and get some one else to take charge of the ruby?
The mandarin's an old mutton-head! If he wasn't he'd
know better than to send the Eye of Buddha to us. And
in a common express package, at that. What value did
he put on it?"</p>

<p>McGlory picked up the wrapper that had covered the
box and looked over the address side.</p>

<p>"No value at all!" he exclaimed. "Either he didn't
think of that, or else he didn't want to pay for the extra
valuation. If there had been a railroad wreck, and the
ruby had been lost, our excellent mandarin would have
collected just fifty plunks from the express company&mdash;and
I reckon the Eye of Buddha is worth fifty thousand
if it's worth a cent."</p>

<p>"Sometimes," said Matt reflectively, "it's safer to trust
to luck than to put such a terrific value on a package
that's to be carried by express."</p>

<p>"Well," grunted McGlory, "I don't like his blooming
Oriental way of doing business, and that shot goes as it
lays. I'll tell you what we can do," he added, brightening.</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"We can jump aboard that New York boat and tote the
ruby back to New York; then we can hunt up Tsan Ti
and return the thing to him and tell him not any&mdash;that
we have done as much for him as we're going to.
Where's his letter sent from? What's the name of the
hotel?"</p>

<p>In his eagerness, McGlory snatched the letter from
Matt's knee and began looking it over.</p>

<p>"There's no address," said Matt.</p>

<p>"Tsan Ti may be in Chinatown," went on McGlory.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
"Such a big high boy couldn't get lost in the shuffle
around Pell and Doyer Streets. Let's go on by that boat
and take our chances locating him!"</p>

<p>"No," and Matt shook his head decidedly, "that's a
move we can't make, Joe. I'm no more in love with this
piece of work than you are, but we're in for it, and there's
no way to dodge. Tsan Ti has unloaded the ruby upon
us and we've got to stand for it."</p>

<p>"But we're responsible&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Of course, up to a certain point. If the stone should
be taken away from us, though, Tsan Ti couldn't hold us
responsible. We didn't ask for the job of looking after
it, and we don't want the job, but we're doing what we
can, you see, because there's no other way out of it."</p>

<p>"You could stow it away in a safer place than your
pocket," grumbled McGlory.</p>

<p>"In that event," returned Matt, "we might be responsible.
The thing for us to do is to follow out our instructions
to the letter. If anything happens to the Eye of
Buddha then it's the mandarin himself who's responsible."</p>

<p>"And we're to hang out in the Catskill Mountains until
Tsan Ti comes for the ruby!" mused McGlory, in an
angry undertone; "and he's not going to come until Grattan
is 'beheaded' or clapped into jail. We're liable to
have a long wait. Of all the tinhorns I ever saw, or
heard of, that Grattan is the sharpest of the lot. Fine
job this red-button heathen has put onto us!"</p>

<p>Matt disliked the work of taking care of the valuable
gem, and he would have shirked the responsibility if he
could have done so, but there was no way in which this
could be brought about. He and Joe would have to stay
in the Catskills, for a while anyway, and wait for Tsan Ti
to present himself. Meanwhile, the trip to New York
would have to be postponed.</p>

<p>More to soothe his friend than as an expression of his
own feelings, the king of the motor boys began taking a
pleasanter view of the situation.</p>

<p>"We know, pard," said he, "that Tsan Ti is a man of
his word. When he says he'll do anything, he does it.
He'll come for the ruby, and I think he's clever enough
to fool Grattan, and we know he'll pay us a thousand dollars.
That money will come in handy while we're in
New York."</p>

<p>"If we ever get there," growled the cowboy. "We may
get into so much trouble on account of that Eye of
Buddha that we'll be laid up in the hospital when Tsan Ti
presents himself in these parts."</p>

<p>Matt laughed.</p>

<p>"You're so anxious to see the sights in the big town,
Joe," he observed, "that it's the delay, more than anything
else, that's bothering you."</p>

<p>"When I get started for anywhere," answered McGlory,
"a bee line and the keen jump is my motto. But,
so long as we have anything to do with Tsan Ti, we never
know what's going to happen. I wish the squinch-eyed
heathen would leave us alone."</p>

<p>Just then a form rounded the front of the hotel, gained
the steps leading up to the porch, and climbed to a place
in front of the motor boys.</p>

<p>McGlory lifted his eyes. The moment they rested on
the form, and realization of who it was had flashed
through his brain, he jumped for the man and grabbed
him with both hands.</p>

<p>"Bunce!" he whooped. "I told you things would begin
to happen, pard, and right here is where they start!"</p>

<p>Then, with considerable violence, McGlory pushed the
old sailor against one of the porch posts, and held him
there, squirming.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">BUNCE HAS A PLAN.</p>


<p>"Avast, there!" gurgled Bunce, half choked, trying to
pull the cowboy's hands from his throat.</p>

<p>The green patch was over his left eye, and the right eye
gleamed glassily in the electric light.</p>

<p>Matt was as much surprised at Bunce's appearance as
was McGlory, but he held his temper better in hand. The
cowboy, profoundly disgusted with the trend of recent
events, showed a disposition to take it out of the sailor.</p>

<p>Had Bunce been even the half of an able seaman he
would have given McGlory a hard scramble, but he
seemed a wizened, infirm old salt, although he had proved
active enough during the experiences the motor boys had
already had with him.</p>

<p>"Don't strangle him, Joe!" called Matt. "Take your
hands from his throat and grab his arm. He came here
openly, and he must have known we were here. Judging
from that, I should say that his intentions are peaceable."</p>

<p>"Ask him," gritted McGlory, "why he doesn't change
eyes with the patch. Let's get to the bottom of this
moving-picture business, too. We can have a little heart-to-heart
talk, I reckon, and find out a few things before
we turn the old webfoot over to the police."</p>

<p>"Right you are, my blood," gasped the half-suffocated
Bunce, as the cowboy dropped his hands to his arm and
dragged him down into a chair, "a heart-to-heart talk's
the thing. Didn't I bear away for this place for nothin'
else than to fall afoul o' ye? Ay, ay, that was the way of
it, but split me through if I ever expected such treatment
as this what I'm a-gettin'. Motor Matt's the lad, says I
to myself, to fill the bill for Bunce, so I trips anchor an'
slants away, only to be laid holt of like I was a reg'lar
skull-and-crossbones, walk-the-plank pirate, with the
Jolly Roger at the peak."</p>

<p>"Oh, put a crimp on that sort of talk," growled McGlory.
"Sufferin' freebooters! If you're anything better
than a pirate, I'd like to have you tell me."</p>

<p>"So, ho!" and Bunce's eye glittered wrathfully, "if I
had a cutlass, my fine buck, I'd slit ye like a herrin' for
that. I'm a fair-weather sort of man, an' I hates a squall,
but stir up nasty weather an' then give me somethin' to
fight with, an' I'm a bit of a handful. Nigh Pangool, on
the south coast o' Java, I laid out a hull boat's crew with
my fists alone, once, not so many years back. That was
when I was mate o' the brig <i>Hottentot</i>, as fine a two-sticker
as ever shoved nose into the South Seas&mdash;reg'lar
bucko mate, I was, an' a main hard man when roused."</p>

<p>At the time the Eye of Buddha was recovered, Bunce
had made his escape with Grattan; and he had been
equally guilty, with Grattan, in the theft of the ruby
from the Honam joss house. That the sailor should
have shown himself at all, in those parts, was a wonder;
and that he should have shown himself to Matt and McGlory,
who knew of his evil deeds, was a puzzle past
working out.</p>

<p>"You say you came here to see me?" inquired Matt.</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, my hearty," answered Bunce. "Motor Matt,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
says I to myself, is the lad to fill the bill for me, an' I
luffed into the wind an' bore down for Catskill. Here I
am, an' here's you, an' if I blow the gaff a bit that's my
business, ain't it? But take me to the cabin; what I has
to say is between us an' the mainmast with no other ears
to get a sizing of it."</p>

<p>McGlory glared at Bunce as though he would have
liked to bore into him with his eyes and see what he had
at the back of his head.</p>

<p>"If you're trying to play double with us, you gangle-legged
old hide rack," he threatened, "you'll live to wish
you'd thought twice before you did it."</p>

<p>"Now, burn me," snorted Bunce, "d'ye take me for a
dog fish? By the seven holy spritsails, I'm as good a
man as you, an' ye'll l'arn&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Enough of that, Bunce," broke in Matt sharply, getting
up from his chair. "You want to say something to
us in private, and I'm going to give you the chance. Come
after me; you trail along behind him, Joe," and, with that,
Matt went into the hotel and up the stairs to the room
jointly occupied by himself and McGlory.</p>

<p>At the door, Matt pushed a button that turned on the
lights. As soon as McGlory and Bunce were in the room,
the door was locked and Matt took charge of the key.</p>

<p>"That's the stuff, pard," approved McGlory, with great
satisfaction. "If the old tinhorn don't spout to please us,
we can phone the office for a policeman."</p>

<p>"Ye're not sending me to the brig this trip, mates,"
spoke up Bunce. "'Cos why? 'Cos in fillin' the bill for
me, ye're givin' the mandarin a leg up out of a purty bad
hole."</p>

<p>"What have you got to tell us?" inquired Matt curtly.
"Out with it, Bunce."</p>

<p>"When ye last seen me, my lad," said Bunce, "I was
sailin' in convoy with Philo Grattan. But he's doin'
things I don't approve of, not any ways. It was all right
to put our helm up an' bear down on a chink joss house
to lift the Eye o' Buddha, an' it was all right, too, when
ye helped the big high boy get the ruby back. That was
all in the game, an' we'd ought to've made the most of it.
But not Philo Grattan. D'ye know what he's layin' to do?
Nothin' more, on my soul, than to strangle Tsan Ti with
a yellow cord an' take the ruby away from him. My eye,
mates, but Grattan's a clever hand at overhauling his
locker for a game like that. The boss of the Chinee
Empire sends these yellow cords to the chinks he don't
like an' don't want around. When the cords come to
hand, then the chinks receivin' thereof uses them to
choke out their lives. Tsan Ti is found, dead as a mackerel,
with the yellow cord twisted into his fat neck. Eye o'
Buddha is missin' from his clothes. What's the answer?
Why, that Tsan Ti lost the ruby, an' used the cord sent
him from the home country. That'll seem plain as a
burgee flyin' from the gaff o' one o' these fresh-water
yachts. Won't it, now?"</p>

<p>Matt knew that Tsan Ti had received the yellow cord
from China, and that he had been allowed two weeks in
which either to find the stolen ruby or to use the cord.
Of course, the ruby had been recovered, and there was
no necessity for using the hideous cord; but, if he was
found strangled, it would have seemed as though he
himself had committed the deed in compliance with orders
from the Chinese regent.</p>

<p>Bunce may have been romancing, but there was a little
plausibility back of his words.</p>

<p>"Where is Grattan?" demanded Matt.</p>

<p>"In these here hills, shipmate," replied Bunce.</p>

<p>"Tsan Ti isn't in the Catskills!"</p>

<p>"No more he ain't, which I grant ye offhand an' freely,
but supposin' he's in Noo York, held a pris'ner in a beach
comber's joint in Front Street? An' supposin', furthermore,
this same beach comber is a mate o' Grattan's, an'
waitin' only for Grattan to come afore he makes Tsan Ti
peg out? Put that in your pipe an' smoke it careful."</p>

<p>"You mean to say that Tsan Ti is a prisoner in New
York&mdash;a prisoner of a confederate of Grattan's?"</p>

<p>"That's gospel truth! It happened recent&mdash;no longer
ago than early mornin'. I bore the word to the beach
comber in a letter of hand from Philo, an' the beach
comber met me in a snug harbor on the front where
sailormen are regularly hocused an' shipped for all
parts. I don't know where the beach comber's place is,
not me, but I did get him topping the boom an' he reported
the whole matter entire. However Tsan Ti fell
into the net is a notch above my understandin', but there
he is, hard an' fast, an' when I'd done with the beach
comber I took the train for Catskill to find Grattan an'
tell him what's been pulled off."</p>

<p>Bunce was a trifle hard to follow.</p>

<p>"Let's see if I've got this right," said Matt, "When
you and Grattan escaped from the officers, at the time the
ruby was recovered, you hid yourselves away among
the Catskills?"</p>

<p>"Ay, so we did!"</p>

<p>"And then Grattan gave you a letter to some man in
New York and you carried it personally?"</p>

<p>"Personally, that's the word. I carried it personally."</p>

<p>"And this man in New York entrapped the mandarin
and is holding him a prisoner until he can hear what
Grattan wants done?"</p>

<p>"Ye've got the proper bearin's, an' no mistake."</p>

<p>"And you came back on the train to tell Grattan?"</p>

<p>Bunce nodded, and pulled at his fringe of whiskers.</p>

<p>"Then, why didn't you go and tell Grattan," asked
Matt, "instead of coming and telling me?"</p>

<p>"I'm no blessed cut-an'-slash pirate," protested Bunce.
"So long as the ruby was to be come by without any
stranglin', I was willin' to bear a bob an' do my share; an'
while mebby there ain't anythin' morilly wrong in chokin'
the breath out of a heathen Chinee, yet they'll bowse a
man up to the yardarm for doin' the same. Mates, on the
ride back to the Catskills I overhauled the hull matter, an'
I makes up my mind I'd sailed in company with Grattan
as long as 'twas safe. If I can save the mandarin, I
thinks to myself, mebby Motor Matt'll play square with
me an' let me off for what I done in helpin' lift the ruby.
If so be he thinks that way, says I to myself further, then
he's the one to fill the bill for Bunce. So, instid o' slantin'
for the cove where the motor car is hid away, I 'bouts
ship an' lays a course for this hotel."</p>

<p>"What's your plan, Bunce?" queried Matt.</p>

<p>"Easy, does it; simple as a granny's knot. You kiss
the Book that I'm free as soon's I do my part, then I
takes you to where Grattan is, an' you lays him by the
heels&mdash;just us three in it an' not a man Jack else. The
beach comber don't do a thing to Tsan Ti till he hears
from Grattan; an' how'll he ever hear from Grattan if
he's safe in irons in some jail in these hills? That's my
plan, an' you take it or leave it. If ye don't follow the
course I've laid, then Grattan gets the ruby back, an' the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
mandarin's life along with it. If ye think I'm talkin'
crooked, an' put the lashings on me an' hand me over to
the police, then not a soul'll ever know where Grattan's
hid, an' he'll clear out an' get to Noo York whether I
see him or not&mdash;but Tsan Ti'll be for Davy Jones' locker,
no matter what ye try to do to prevent it. I've said my
say an' eased my mind; now it's you for it."</p>

<p>With that, Bunce calmly drew a plug of tobacco from
his pocket and nibbled at one corner reflectively.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">BUNCE SPEAKS A GOOD WORD FOR HIMSELF.</p>


<p>Matt made a brief study of Bunce, leaning back in his
seat and gazing at the mariner through half-closed eyes.
The sailorman's get-up reminded Matt of <i>Dick Deadeye</i>
in "Pinafore." Whether Bunce was really a deep-water
humbug, and whether he was to be taken seriously, were
questions that gave Matt a good deal of bother.</p>

<p>"He's stringing us, pard," averred McGlory bluntly.
"That tongue of his is hung in the middle and wags at
both ends."</p>

<p>"Avast, my man-o'-war!" came hotly from the mariner.
"I'm no loafing longshore scuttler to let go my mudhooks
in these waters and then begin splicing the main brace out
of hand. You'll get your whack, my blood, and get it
hard, if you keep on in the style ye're goin'. Belay a bit,
can't you?"</p>

<p>McGlory snorted contemptuously and put his tongue in
his cheek. Bunce began fingering his knife lanyard.</p>

<p>"No more of that give-and-take," said Matt.</p>

<p>"I'm a hard man," observed Bunce, "an' I've lived a
hard life, winnin' my mate's berth on the ole <i>Hottentot</i>
off Trincomalee by bashing in the skull of a Kanaka.
More things I've done as would make your blood run
cold just by listenin' to, but I'm straight as a forestay
for all that, d'ye mind, an' I've a clean bill from every
master I ever sailed with. 'He ain't much fer looks,
Bunce ain't,' as Cap'n Banks, of the ole <i>Hottentot</i> used
to say, 'but in a pinch you don't have to look twice for
Bunce.' An' there ye have it, all wrapped up, tied small,
an' ready for any swab as doubts me."</p>

<p>"Bunce," said Matt dubiously, "I'm frank to say I
don't know just how to take you. By your own confession
you're a thief&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Only when chinks has the loot," cut in Bunce hastily,
"an' when it takes a bit of headwork an' a matchin' o'
wits to beat 'em out."</p>

<p>"You helped Grattan steal the Eye of Buddha. Plotted
it on a sampan off Canton, didn't you?"</p>

<p>Bunce shoved in his chair and showed signs of consternation.</p>

<p>"Scuttle me!" he gulped. "Wherever did you find that
out? Grattan never told you where we had our chin-chin
in the river of Honam."</p>

<p>"It's all pictured out," said Matt, "and you can drop
into a theatre, in this town of Catskill, and see yourself
and Grattan committing the robbery."</p>

<p>Bunce fell limply back.</p>

<p>"So, ho!" he mumbled. "Then them pictures are out,
eh? They wasn't to come out for a month yet&mdash;it was in
the agreement."</p>

<p>"Agreement?"</p>

<p>"Ay, no more nor less. It was on the trip from 'Frisco,
east, mate, when Grattan an' me had the ruby but not a
sou markee in our pockets. We needed money. Grattan
knew some of these moving-picture swabs in Chicago, and
he allowed he could turn a few reds by givin' 'em the
plan of the robbery an' helpin' act it out. 'Avast,' says I,
feelin' a warnin' twinge, 'don't touch it, Philo!' But he
would&mdash;an' did, first gettin' an' agreement from the swabs
that they wouldn't put out the pictures for two months.
We got a couple of hundred yen for the work, an' that's
what brought us on to the Catskills. So it's out, so it's
out," and Bunce wagged his head forebodingly.</p>

<p>"Did you play a part in the pictures, Bunce?" went on
Matt.</p>

<p>"Not I, mate! I may be lackin' in the head, once in a
while, but there's a few keen thoughts rollin' around in
my locker. I wouldn't go in for it, an' you can smoke my
weather roll on that."</p>

<p>"There's a one-eyed sailor in the picture," said Matt.</p>

<p>"And he's a dead ringer for you," added McGlory.</p>

<p>"Which it ain't me, d'ye see?" scowled the mariner.
"It's a counterfeit, got up to look like me&mdash;an' nothin'
more."</p>

<p>"Then it's a mighty good counterfeit," averred the cowboy.</p>

<p>"I'm a man o' high principles, mate, even though I do
say it as shouldn't. I was brought up right, by a Marblehead
fisherman who hated rum, couldn't abide playin'
cards, an' believed the-ay-ters was milestones on the road
to the hot place. Actin' in a play I wouldn't think of, an'
that's the flat of it. But what's the good word, shipmate?
Are you sailin' this cruise wi' me to save the life o' the
mandarin? I must know one way or t'other."</p>

<p>"Where is Grattan?"</p>

<p>"Five miles away, snug as a bug in a rug where he'll
never be found onless I con the course. We'll have to go
to him soon, if he's captured. I'm due at the meetin'
place to-night."</p>

<p>"You spoke of a motor car&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ay, that I did. It's hid in the woods beyond the railroad
yards. We'll use that."</p>

<p>"You had a couple of motorcycles," said Matt.</p>

<p>"Which you and Grattan stole from us," supplemented
McGlory. "What's become of them, Bunce?"</p>

<p>"Wrecked an' sunk," answered Bunce. "Mine sprung
a leak an' went over a cliff in fifty fathoms of air; Grattan's
bounced up on a reef an' went to pieces. Then we
lifted the motor car, usin' of it for night cruises."</p>

<p>"You stole a motor car, eh?" said McGlory grimly.
"And on top of that you have the nerve to come along
here and speak a good word for yourself."</p>

<p>"Stow it," growled Bunce, "or you an' I'll be at loggerheads
for good. What's the word?" and he turned his
gleaming eye on Matt. "You can use the telephone an'
hand me over to the police, or you can do as I say an'
save the mandarin. What's the word?"</p>

<p>"When will we have to start after Grattan?" asked
Matt.</p>

<p>"By early mornin', mate, just when it's light enough to
see."</p>

<p>"And where'll we meet you?"</p>

<p>"In the woods beyond the railroad yards. Go there,
stand on the track, an' whistle. I'll whistle back, then
we'll come together&mdash;an' fill the bill."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>"You can expect us at six o'clock," said Motor Matt,
unlocking the door and pulling it open.</p>

<p>"Brayvo, my bully!" enthused Bunce. "An' ye'll come
armed? Grattan is a hard man, an' sizable in a scrimmage."</p>

<p>"We'll be prepared to take care of Grattan," answered
Matt. "Good night, Bunce."</p>

<p>"Good night it is," and the mariner vanished into the
hall.</p>

<p>As soon as the door was again closed, Matt turned to
find McGlory staring at him as though he thought he was
crazy.</p>

<p>"Sufferin' tinhorns!" exclaimed the cowboy. "You
can't mean it, pard?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do," was the answer.</p>

<p>"Why, that old fore-and-after never told the truth in
his life! He was using his imagination overtime."</p>

<p>"The chances are that he was, but there's a bare possibility
he was telling the truth. We know Tsan Ti is in
New York, and we can't feel absolutely sure that the
Chinaman hasn't fallen into some trap laid by Grattan.
If that's the case, the mandarin may lose his life."</p>

<p>"There's about as much chance of that, pard, as that
you and I will get struck by lightning."</p>

<p>"We'll say the chance that Bunce is telling the truth is
about one in a hundred. Well, Joe, that hundredth
chance is what we can't take. Besides, Grattan is wanted.
If he is really in the hills, and we can capture him, that
will clear the road for Tsan Ti."</p>

<p>"But what will you do with the Eye of Buddha?"</p>

<p>Matt was in a quandary about that.</p>

<p>"Will you tote it along on a trip of this kind?" proceeded
Joe, "or will you leave it in the hotel safe? Maybe
that's what Bunce is playing for."</p>

<p>"He don't know we have the ruby. How could he?"</p>

<p>"I'm by. But he's up to something, and that's a cinch."</p>

<p>"We'll have to give him the benefit of the doubt&mdash;on
account of Tsan Ti."</p>

<p>"Consarn that bungling chink!" grunted the cowboy,
venting his anger on the mandarin as the original cause of
their perplexing situation. "You can't do a thing with
that red stone but lug it along."</p>

<p>"If the banks were open between now and the time we
start, I might leave it with one of them for safe-keeping."</p>

<p>"And go dead against your letter of instructions! Then
you would be responsible."</p>

<p>"I'll think it over to-night," said Matt, and began his
preparations for turning in.</p>

<p>But sleeping over the question didn't answer it. Matt's
quandary lasted until far into the night.</p>

<p>He had no faith in Bunce; he couldn't understand why
Tsan Ti should have sent the ruby to him for safe-keeping;
he doubted the wisdom of going into the hills with
the mariner, and he understood well the risk of carrying
the priceless Eye of Buddha with him on the morning's
venture.</p>

<p>When McGlory opened his eyes in the first gray of the
morning, Matt was tying up the box in which the ruby
had come by express.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do, pard?" inquired the cowboy,
jumping out of bed and beginning to scramble into
his clothes.</p>

<p>"I guess, after all," answered Matt, "that I'll leave this
box with the clerk."</p>

<p>"Wish I knew whether that was the proper caper, or
not, but I don't. One thing's as good as another, I
reckon."</p>

<p>At five-thirty they had a hurried breakfast, and, a little
before six, Matt handed the small box to the hotel clerk
and asked him to put it away in the office safe. Then
the motor boys started for the railroad track and followed
it away from the river and into the wooded ravine beyond
the yards.</p>

<p>"This is far enough, I guess," said Matt, and began to
whistle.</p>

<p>The signal was promptly returned from a place on the
left, and the head of the mariner was pushed through a
thicket of bushes.</p>

<p>"Ahoy, my hearties!" came from Bunce. "Come up
here and bear a fist with the car, will ye?"</p>

<p>Puzzled not a little at this request, Matt and McGlory
climbed the bank of the ravine and came alongside the
mariner on a small, cleared shelf on the bank side. The
"motor car" was before them, and at sight of it McGlory
exploded a laugh.</p>

<p>"Speak to me about this!" he exclaimed. "Had you
any notion it was this sort of a bubble, Matt?"</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">THE HOMEMADE SPEEDER.</p>


<p>What Matt saw was an ordinary hand car equipped
with a two-cylinder gasoline engine. Across one end of
the car was a bench, tightly bolted to the framework;
back of this was a shorter bench for the driver of the
queer machine. The king of the motor boys examined
the car with a good deal of curiosity. Power was communicated
to the rear axle by chain and sprocket. The
gasoline tank was under the driver's bench, and he unscrewed
the cap and tested the fuel supply by means of
a clean twig picked up from the shelf.</p>

<p>"Oh, she's loaded full," wheezed Bunce. "I filled her
myself, not more'n ten minutes ago."</p>

<p>"Do you know anything about motors, Bunce?" inquired
Matt, giving the mariner a sharp look.</p>

<p>"Ay, that I do&mdash;in a way. I can turn on the oil and
the spark when I wants to start, an' I can cut 'em off an'
jam on the brakes when I wants to stop. That's all ye
got to know in runnin' these benzine machines."</p>

<p>"Where does this belong?"</p>

<p>"Track inspector owns it. Grattan an' me borried it."
Bunce grinned. "When we're done with the machine,
we'll give it back."</p>

<p>"We'll make a picture, pard," grumbled McGlory,
"trailin' along with this tinhorn on a stolen speeder."</p>

<p>"Avast, I say!" growled Bunce. "Ye're too free with
your jaw tackle. Lend a hand, an' let's get her on the
track an' make off. The section gang'll be out purty
soon, an' we want to be away afore they see us."</p>

<p>"Sure you do," agreed McGlory sarcastically. "It'll be
healthier for my pard and me, too, I reckon, if we're
absent when the section men come along. That's why
you wanted to make such an early start, eh?"</p>

<p>Without more ado, the motor boys helped Bunce get
the speeder down the slope and upon the rails.</p>

<p>"Any trains coming or going at this hour?" asked
Matt, with sudden thought.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>"Say," jeered McGlory, "it would be fine if we went
head on into a local passenger!"</p>

<p>"No trains comin' or goin', mate," said Bunce. "That's
another reason for the early start. Want me to run the
thing?"</p>

<p>"I'll do the running," answered Matt. "You climb up
in front with McGlory."</p>

<p>Bunce and McGlory got on the front bench. Matt
"turned the engine over" by running with the speeder
for a few steps, then climbed to his seat, and they began
laboring up a stiff grade through the ravine.</p>

<p>The road was full of curves, and when it couldn't go
around a hill it went over it.</p>

<p>From his talk with Bunce, the night before, Matt had
been under the impression that the stolen car was an automobile,
and he had made up his mind to return the car
to its owner&mdash;if the man's name could be learned&mdash;after
it had been used for running down Philo Grattan. Now,
that he had discovered that the car was a track speeder,
he was no less resolved to hand it over to the railroad
company on the return to Catskill.</p>

<p>The speeder performed fairly well, considering that it
must have been knocked together in the company's shops
by men whose knowledge of their work was not extensive.
A secondhand automobile engine had furnished
the motor.</p>

<p>"This isn't so bad," remarked McGlory, as they ducked
around the shoulder of a hill, still on the up grade, with
the motor fretting and pounding. "A motor ride's a
motor ride, whether you're on an aëroplane, or rubber
tires, or steel rails."</p>

<p>"This is what they call a joy ride, Joe," called Matt,
from the rear. "The owner of the car doesn't know we're
out with it. I'll return it to the railroad company when
we're through with our morning's work."</p>

<p>"That's you. I hope the railroad company don't find
out we've got it before we give it back. Gee, man, how
she's workin'!"</p>

<p>"Fine day an' clear weather for fillin' the bill," remarked
Bunce. "Did ye come armed, mateys?"</p>

<p>"Sufferin' hold-ups!" exclaimed McGlory. "Did you
think for a minute, Bunce, we'd jump into this without
being heeled?"</p>

<p>The cowboy, as he spoke, reached behind him and drew
a short, wicked-looking six-shooter from his hip pocket.</p>

<p>Bunce recoiled.</p>

<p>"Where'd you get that, Joe?" asked Matt.</p>

<p>"Borrowed it from the hotel clerk."</p>

<p>"Well, put it away. I don't think we're going to need
it. If we find Grattan there'll be three of us to take care
of him. He's alone, I suppose, Bunce?"</p>

<p>"Sailin' by himself, mate," answered the mariner. "Better
le' me take the gun, my hearty," he added, to McGlory.</p>

<p>"Speak to me about that!" scoffed the cowboy.
"Why?"</p>

<p>"I'll have to go for'ard when we come close to the
place, an' if Philo gets vi'lent, I'll look at him over the
gun, an' it'll be soothin'."</p>

<p>"I'm able to soothe him, I reckon, no matter whether
you're ahead or behind."</p>

<p>The speeder was making a terrific clatter. Everything
rattled&mdash;the brake shoes barged against the wheel
flanges, the engine rocked on its bed, and the levers
jarred in their guides. In order to talk, and make themselves
heard, those aboard had to lift their voices.</p>

<p>"Sufferin' Bedlam!" cried McGlory. "It's a wonder
Grattan and Bunce were ever able to steal a rattletrap
like this and get away with it. We're making more noise
than a limited express."</p>

<p>Suddenly the motor gave a flash and a sputter and went
out of business. In a twinkling the car lost headway and
began sliding back down the grade toward Catskill. Matt
threw on the brakes. The rear wheels locked, but still
the car continued to slide downward. Shutting off the
power, Matt dropped into the roadbed over the back of
the bench, cleared the rails at a leap, and wedged one of
the wheels with a stone. He had been obliged to work
rapidly, for the car was on the move, and going faster
and faster, as its weight gathered headway. But the
stone sufficed, and the speeder was brought to a standstill.</p>

<p>"What took us aback, like that?" demanded Bunce.</p>

<p>"Too much gasoline," answered Matt, tinkering with
the supply pipe, "and I couldn't check it with the lever
control."</p>

<p>"This is a great old chug cart," laughed McGlory.
"The railroad company ought to have been willing to pay
somebody for running away with it. How'd you ever
get over this road with it, Bunce?"</p>

<p>"When I came over the road it was downhill," answered
the mariner, "an' all I had to do was to keep the
craft on her course, an' scud along under bare poles."</p>

<p>"You had to climb a hill before you took the down
grade, didn't you?"</p>

<p>"Ay, so I did, but the car came up the hill easy
enough."</p>

<p>Matt soon had the valve in the supply pipe adjusted,
and all hands had to push in giving the car a start. When
they were going, and the engine had taken up its cycle,
there followed a wild scramble to get aboard. This was
finally accomplished, and once more they were puffing up
the hill, but with less pounding than before.</p>

<p>"Say, Bunce," demanded McGlory suddenly, "did you
take the speeder off the track and up the slope into those
bushes alone?"</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, mate," was the answer. "But I had a rope
and tackle to help."</p>

<p>McGlory was convinced that Bunce was wide of the
truth, and Matt inclined to the same opinion, although
why the mariner wanted to deceive them in such a small
matter was difficult to understand.</p>

<p>Presently, to the great relief of the motor boys, the
top of the hill was reached. The descent angled downward,
around rocky uplifts and through thick timber, so
that it was impossible to watch the track in advance for
any considerable distance.</p>

<p>The descent, on such a makeshift power car as the
speeder, was fraught with greater perils than the climb up
the mountain. No power would be necessary, for the
car would go fast enough without any added impetus.
In order to keep it from going too fast, and jumping the
track, the brakes would have to be judiciously used.</p>

<p>"We're off!" cried McGlory, as the speeder began
coasting down the grade.</p>

<p>Matt tried out the brakes. They were capable of
slackening the pace, but as for stopping the car, no
appliance could have done that.</p>

<p>With rear wheels locked, the speeder hurled itself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
down the mountain, acquiring greater and greater speed
as it went. In and out of cuts the car dashed, here and
there rumbling over a trestle which gave the passengers
fearful glimpses of space below them.</p>

<p>McGlory and Bunce hung to their bench with both
hands. There was no talking, now, for all three passengers
were holding their breath.</p>

<p>Finally the descent became less steep. As the grade
flattened out slowly into something approaching a level,
Matt's work with the brakes began to achieve results.
By degrees the mad flight of the car commenced to
slacken.</p>

<p>"Sharp curve ahead!" sang out McGlory, heaving a
deep breath of relief as the car continued to slow down.</p>

<p>Matt saw the sharp turn in the track where it rounded
a shoulder of rock. Naturally he could not see around
the turn, and he was speculating as to whether their reduced
speed would be sufficient to throw the speeder
off the rails at the bend, or whether the car would make
it safely.</p>

<p>Before his calculations had been brought to an end, the
problem was working itself out.</p>

<p>The speeder struck the curve, whirled around it with a
shrieking of flanges against the rails, and then there went
up a wild yell from McGlory and Bunce.</p>

<p>Directly in front of the car was a tie across the track!</p>

<p>A collision with the tie was inevitable. Matt foresaw
it, and clung desperately to his bench.</p>

<p>"Brace yourselves!" he yelled.</p>

<p>The next moment they struck the tie.</p>

<p>The jolt was terrific. Motor Matt was thrown roughly
against the seat in front, and Bunce went into the air as
though shot from a gun.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">TRAPPED.</p>


<p>Matt saw that McGlory had managed, like himself, to
stay with the car, then both motor boys had a flash-light
glimpse of the mariner ricochetting through the atmosphere
and striking earth right side up by the track. But
Bunce did not remain in an upright position. The force
with which he had been thrown launched him into a series
of eccentric cartwheels, and when he finally stopped turning
he was in a sitting posture, with his back against a
bowlder.</p>

<p>Apparently he had escaped serious injury, which was a
remarkable fact, in view of the circumstances. A broken
neck might easily have resulted, or, at the least, a fractured
arm or leg.</p>

<p>"Shiver me!" gasped Bunce, dazed and bewildered by
the suddenness of it all.</p>

<p>Then Motor Matt's and McGlory's shocked senses laid
hold of another detail of the situation which was most astounding.</p>

<p>The green patch had been shaken from the mariner's
head, and he was peering around him with two good
eyes!</p>

<p>"Tell me about that!" roared McGlory, pointing.
"Look at his lamps, Matt! He's got two!"</p>

<p>"I see," answered Matt grimly. "Suppose we approach
closer, Joe, and find out about this."</p>

<p>Bunce watched the boys descend from the speeder and
advance upon him, but there was still a dazed gleam in
his eyes which proved that he was slow in recovering his
wits.</p>

<p>"Are you all right, Bunce?" asked Matt, reaching the
mariner's side and bending down.</p>

<p>"That&mdash;that craft must have&mdash;have turned a handspring,"
mumbled Bunce. "Purty tolerable blow we had,
mates, an' I was snatched away from the bench, an'
tossed overboard. It was done so quick I&mdash;I hardly
knowed what was goin' on. By the seven holy spritsails!
it's a wonder I'm shipshape an' all together." He
got up slowly and began feeling gingerly of his arms
and legs. "Nothin' busted, I guess," he added.</p>

<p>The ground where he had landed was cushioned with
sand. To this fact, more than to anything else, he owed
his escape from injury.</p>

<p>McGlory picked up the green patch.</p>

<p>"Here's an ornament you dropped during that ground-and-lofty
tumbling, you old tinhorn," said he. "What did
you wear it for, anyhow?"</p>

<p>"Blow me tight!" exclaimed Bunce, staring at the patch
with falling jaw. "Ain't that reedic'lous?" he added, with
a feeble attempt to treat the matter lightly.</p>

<p>"It is rather ridiculous, Bunce, and that's a fact," answered
Matt. "You've a pair of very good eyes, it seems
to me, and what's the good of that patch?"</p>

<p>The mariner grabbed the bit of green cloth and pulled
the string over his head.</p>

<p>"I never said I'd lost one o' my lamps," he averred, settling
the patch in place. "Off Table Mountain, South
Africy, a cable parted on the ole <i>Hottentot</i>, an' I was hit
in the eye with a loose rope's end. For a while, I thought
I was goin' blind. But I didn't, only the eye has been
weak ever sence, an' needs purtection. That's why I
wear the patch."</p>

<p>"You've got it over the wrong eye, Bunce," observed
McGlory. "You've been wearing it over the left eye, and
now it's over the right. Have you got any clear notion
which eye was hit with that rope's end?"</p>

<p>Bunce hastily changed the position of the patch.</p>

<p>"I'm that rattled," said he, "that I'm all ahoo, an' don't
rightly know what I'm about. I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>For an instant he stared up the track, breaking off his
words abruptly; then, without any further explanation,
he whirled and rushed for the timber.</p>

<p>With a yell of anger, McGlory started after him.</p>

<p>"Come back, Joe!" shouted Matt. "Here come some
men who seem to have business with us."</p>

<p>The cowboy whirled to an about face, and followed
with his eyes the direction of his chum's pointing finger.</p>

<p>Four men in flannel shirts and overalls, and carrying
spades, picks, and tamping irons, were hurrying up the
track in the direction of the curve.</p>

<p>"The section gang!" muttered McGlory.</p>

<p>"A good guess," laughed Matt. "We've been trapped."</p>

<p>"Trapped?"</p>

<p>"That's the way it looks to me. We were seen coming
down the mountain and those men, recognizing the
speeder, laid the tie across the rails to catch the thieves."</p>

<p>"Sufferin' kiboshes, but here's a go! This comes of
trying to fill the bill for an old tinhorn like Bunce."</p>

<p>"Ketched!" yelled one of the approaching men, flourishing
a tamping iron; "we've ketched the robbers that
run off with Mulvaney's speeder! Don't you make no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
trouble," he added, slowing his pace and coming more
warily.</p>

<p>The other three men spread out and then closed in,
barring escape for the motor boys in every direction.</p>

<p>"You've made a mistake," said Matt.</p>

<p>"Oh, sure!" jeered the section boss, "but I reckon we'll
take ye to Catskill, an' let ye tell the superintendent all
about the mistake."</p>

<p>"Don't be in a rush about taking us to Catskill," threatened
McGlory. "You listen to what Motor Matt says,
and I reckon he'll make the layout clear to you."</p>

<p>"Motor Matt!" returned the boss ironically. "Why
don't ye say ye're the governor o' the State, or somethin'
like that? Ye might jest as well. Motor Matt ain't
stealin' speeders an' runnin' off with 'em."</p>

<p>The king of the motor boys had become pretty well
known in the Catskills through his previous work in recovering
the ruby for Tsan Ti. Even these section men
had heard of his exploits. Matt, seeing the impression
his cowboy pard's words had made, resolved to prove his
identity in the hope of avoiding trouble.</p>

<p>"What my chum says is true, men," he declared. "I am
Motor Matt. We didn't steal the railroad speeder. That
was done by the man who was with us&mdash;the fellow who
ran away. You saw him, didn't you?"</p>

<p>"Sure we saw him," answered the section boss, "but I
wouldn't try to put it all off onto him, if I was you."</p>

<p>"Sufferin' blockheads!" rumbled McGlory. "Use your
brains, if you've got any, can't you? Do we look like
thieves?"</p>

<p>"Can't most always tell from a feller's looks what he
is," returned the boss skeptically. "And this other chap
can't be Motor Matt, nuther, or he wouldn't have stole
the speeder. That there speeder has been missin' for
three days, an' orders has gone out, up an' down the line,
for all hands to watch out for it. When I seen it comin'
down the grade, I knowed we had ye. All we done was
to throw that tie acrost the track, an' the trick was done.
Ye'll have to go to Catskill, that's all about it."</p>

<p>"Are you men from Catskill?" inquired Matt.</p>

<p>"No, Tannersville, but Catskill's the place you're
wanted. We'll put ye on the passenger, when it comes
along."</p>

<p>"But we don't want to go back to Catskill just yet,"
Matt demurred. "We've got business here, and it can't
be put off."</p>

<p>Matt believed that Bunce had run to get away from the
section men, who, he must have realized, had caused the
speeder's mishap in the hope of catching the ones who
had stolen the car. There was yet a chance, Matt
thought, to overhaul Bunce and find Grattan. To go
back to Catskill, just then, would have been disastrous
to the work he and McGlory were trying to do under
the mariner's leadership.</p>

<p>"Sure ye don't want to go to Catskill," went on the
section boss, "right now, or any other time. But ye're
goin', all the same. Grab 'em, you men," and the boss
shouted the order to the three who had grouped themselves
around Matt and McGlory.</p>

<p>"Hands off!" shouted the cowboy.</p>

<p>Matt saw him jerk the revolver from his pocket, and
aim it at the man who was reaching to lay hold of him.
The man fell back with an oath of consternation.</p>

<p>"Don't do that, Joe!" cried Matt.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," sneered the boss, "you fellers ain't thieves, I
guess! What're you pullin' a gun on us for, if ye ain't?"</p>

<p>"I'm not going to argue the case with you any further,"
Matt answered shortly. "We're going back to
Catskill after a while, but not now. When we get there
we'll report to your superintendent and explain how we
happened to be aboard the stolen speeder. I was intending
to return the car to the railroad company as soon as
we had got through with it, and then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sure ye was!" mocked the boss. "Ye wasn't intendin'
to do anythin' but what was right an' lawful&mdash;to hear
ye tell it. We got ye trapped, an' I ain't goin' to fool with
ye any longer. Put down that gun, you!" and he
whirled savagely upon McGlory. "We're goin' to take
ye, an' if you do any shootin' ye'll find yerselves in a
deeper hole than what ye are now."</p>

<p>"You keep away from me," scowled McGlory, still
holding the weapon leveled, "and keep your men away
from me. Try to touch either of us, and this gun will
begin to talk. We're not thieves, but that's something we
can't pound into your thick head, so we're going to attend
to our business in spite of you."</p>

<p>The section boss was a man of courage, and was resolute
in his intention to take the boys to Catskill. Certainly,
so far as appearances went, he had the right of
the matter, and Matt didn't feel that he could explain
the exact situation with any chance of having his words
believed.</p>

<p>"Here's where I'm comin' for ye," proceeded the section
boss, "an' if you shoot, you'll be tagged with more
kinds o' trouble than you can take care of. Now&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The section boss got no farther. Just at that moment
the rumble of a train coming up the grade could be heard.
Instantly the attention of the section boss was called to
another matter.</p>

<p>"The passenger!" he cried, jumping around and staring
at the speeder and the tie. "There'll be a wreck if
we don't clear the track. Come on, men! Hustle!"</p>

<p>The peril threatening the passenger train banished
from the minds of the section men all thought of the
boys. All four of the gang ran to remove the obstructions
from the rails.</p>

<p>"Come on, pard!" said McGlory; "now's our chance."</p>

<p>Matt, with a feeling of intense relief, bounded after his
chum, and they were soon well away in the timber.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">THE CUT-OUT UNDER THE LEDGE.</p>


<p>McGlory was inclined to view recent events in a
humorous light.</p>

<p>"Speak to me about that, pard!" he laughed, when he
and Matt had halted for breath, and to determine, if possible,
which way Bunce had gone. "I told you what was
on the programme if you became trustee for the Eye of
Buddha. We never know when lightning's going to
strike, or how."</p>

<p>"I don't like episodes of that sort," muttered Matt.
"It puts us in a bad light, Joe."</p>

<p>"Oh, hang that part of it! We can explain the whole
thing to the railroad superintendent as soon as we get
back to Catskill. That section boss was a saphead. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
couldn't pound any reason into his block with a sledge
hammer. Forget it!"</p>

<p>"But you drew a gun on the section men. That makes
the business look bad for us."</p>

<p>McGlory chuckled. "See here, pard," said he. With
that, he "broke" the revolver and exposed the end of the
cylinder.</p>

<p>There were no cartridges in the weapon!</p>

<p>"Now, what do you think?" laughed the cowboy. "I
borrowed the gun in a hurry, and didn't think to ask
whether it was loaded&mdash;and I reckon the hotel clerk
didn't think to tell me. It's about as dangerous as a
piece of bologna sausage, but it looks ugly&mdash;and that's
about all there is to this revolver proposition, anyhow."</p>

<p>Matt enjoyed the recent experience, in which the harmless
revolver had played its part, fully as much as his
chum.</p>

<p>"Well," said the king of the motor boys, "what's done
can't be helped, and we'd better be about our business
with Bunce. But what's become of the mariner? He
ought to be around here, somewhere."</p>

<p>"He's ducked," returned McGlory, "and I'll bet it's
for good. We've found out he had a pair of good eyes,
and he's got shy of us."</p>

<p>"If we don't find him," mused Matt, "it's a clear case
that he was playing double with us. If we do find him,
then we can take a little more stock in what he tells us
about Tsan Ti. It will be worth something to feel sure,
either way."</p>

<p>"Maybe you're right, but how are we going to pick up
the webfoot's trail?"</p>

<p>Matt studied the ground. The earth was soft from a recent
rain, and the fact gave him an idea.</p>

<p>"Track him, Joe. You're used to that sort of thing.
Put your knowledge to some account."</p>

<p>"In order to track the mariner," said McGlory, "we'll
have to go back to the place where we saw him duck into
the timber. It'll be a tough job, but I'm willing to try if
we can once pick up the trail."</p>

<p>"That's the only thing for us to do. If Bunce was intending
to deal squarely with us, he'd have shown himself
before this."</p>

<p>"Let's see," mused the cowboy. "He said that Grattan
was hiding out about five miles from Catskill, didn't he?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then I reckon the place is somewhere around here.
We're about five miles from the town, I should judge.
Still," and disgust welled up in the cowboy as he voiced
the thought, "you can't tell whether Bunce was giving
that part of it straight, or not. He's about as crooked as
they make 'em, that tinhorn."</p>

<p>The boys, during their talk, had been moving slowly
back in the direction of the railroad track. Cautiously
they came to the edge of the timber, close to the right
of way, on the alert not only for the tracks left by Bunce,
but for the presence of the section men, as well.</p>

<p>The section gang, they discovered, had left the vicinity
of the sharp curve, and were nowhere in sight. The
speeder, badly shaken by the jar of its collision with the
tie, was off the rails, and the tie lay beside it.</p>

<p>"No sign of the section men," announced Matt, after a
careful survey of the track.</p>

<p>"Mighty good thing for us, too, pard," said McGlory.
"Here's Bunce's trail, and he traveled so fast he only hit
the ground with his toes. Come on! I can run it out
for a ways, anyhow."</p>

<p>McGlory's life on the cattle ranges had made him particularly
apt in the lore of the plains. The trail was very
dim in places, but even the disturbed leaves under the
trees, and the broken bushes told McGlory where the
mariner had passed.</p>

<p>The course taken by Bunce led across a timbered "flat"
and down into a rocky ravine, then along the ravine to a
ledge of rock which jutted out from a side hill. The under
side of the ledge was perhaps a dozen feet over the
bottom of the ravine, and under it was a sort of "pocket"
in the hill.</p>

<p>Here there were evidences of a primitive camp. The
soft earth under the ledge was trampled by human feet,
and there was a large, five-gallon can that had once held
gasoline, but which was now empty. A small mound of
dried leaves had been heaped up at the innermost recess
of the "pocket," and the bed still bore the faint impression
of a man's body.</p>

<p>"Bunce was right about Grattan being in hiding near
Catskill," observed Matt. "Here's the place, sure
enough."</p>

<p>"And Bunce came here, pard," went on McGlory; "he
made tracks straight for this hang-out as soon as he got
clear of us. Judging from what we see, I should say
Bunce met Grattan, and that they both hurried off. But
what was that gasoline for?"</p>

<p>"For the speeder, maybe," replied Matt.</p>

<p>"They wouldn't keep the gasoline supply for the
speeder so far from the track, would they?"</p>

<p>"I shouldn't think so; still, I can't imagine what else
they'd want gasoline for."</p>

<p>"What sort of a game was Bunce up to? If Grattan
was here, then everything was going right, so far as the
plan to capture Grattan was concerned. Why didn't
Bunce wait for us, back there in the timber, and give us
the chance to come on here and put the kibosh on the
man we want?"</p>

<p>"It's a mystery, Joe," said the puzzled Matt. "Perhaps
Bunce believed that we'd be captured by the section men
and that it wouldn't be possible to get hold of Grattan.
If he thought that, he might have come on to this place,
given his New York report to Grattan, and made up his
mind to see the rascally game through to a finish. Bunce
couldn't have any idea that we'd escape from the section
gang."</p>

<p>"Well," growled McGlory, "he might have waited and
made certain of it."</p>

<p>There was no accounting for the queer actions of the
mariner. It seemed as though, after the collision with the
railroad tie and the coming of the section men, he had
changed his mind about helping the boys capture Grattan.</p>

<p>Matt and McGlory moved around under the ledge, trying
to find something else that would point positively to
the presence of Grattan in the "pocket."</p>

<p>There was a strong odor of gasoline&mdash;much stronger
than would have come from the uncorked, empty can.
Suddenly Matt found something, and hurriedly called his
chum.</p>

<p>"What is it?" inquired McGlory, running to Matt's
side.</p>

<p>Matt pointed to two straight lines in the earth, leading
out and up the ravine.</p>

<p>"Motorcycles," said he laconically, "two of them!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>McGlory struck his fist against his open palm.</p>

<p>"Well, what do you think of that!" he cried. "Motorcycles
and speeders! Say, those tinhorns were well fixed
in the motor line. And Bunce told us both motorcycles
had been destroyed! Sufferin' Ananias, but he's a
tongue twister!"</p>

<p>"There's no doubt but that Grattan was here," went on
Matt, "and that he had the two motorcycles with him.
The gasoline was used to fill the motorcycles' tanks. As
soon as Bunce got to this place, the wheels were made
ready and Bunce and Grattan rode off."</p>

<p>"They're headed for New York, I reckon, to 'fill the
bill' for poor old Tsan Ti!"</p>

<p>"I don't believe it," declared Matt. "I didn't take much
stock in the story when Bunce told it, but on the chance
that it might be true, I felt as though we should give Tsan
Ti the benefit of the doubt. But, now, I'm fairly certain
the yarn was all moonshine."</p>

<p>"Bunce took a whole lot of trouble for nothing, pard,"
commented McGlory. "What was the good of his coming
to the hotel, running the risk of our turning him over
to the police, and then motoring out here with us on that
ramshackle speeder if he never intended to help us capture
Grattan?"</p>

<p>"Maybe we'll discover that later. Suppose we follow
the trail of the motorcycles, Joe?"</p>

<p>"Why? They're a dozen miles from here, by this time."</p>

<p>"We can't overtake them, of course, but we can discover
which way they went."</p>

<p>It was an easy matter to trail the heavy machines up
the ravine. About half a mile above the camp under the
ledge, a wagon road crossed the ravine, and the wheels
had turned into it. To the surprise of the boys, the wheels
had turned in the direction of Catskill.</p>

<p>"It can't be those two tinhorns would have the nerve
to go to the town," said McGlory.</p>

<p>"I don't think they would," agreed Matt, "but they
have gone in that direction, at all events. It's up to us to
walk back, so we may as well follow the road and the
motorcycle trail."</p>

<p>"This is what I call tough luck," said the cowboy, when
he and Matt were swinging along the road. "I didn't
think there was any sense taking up with Bunce, in the
first place. Nice way for that move to pan out! We go
gunning for Grattan on a speeder, and then hoof it back&mdash;to
face a charge of robbery preferred by the section
men!"</p>

<p>"We'll settle that robbery charge quick enough," returned
Matt.</p>

<p>"No doubt about that. I wouldn't feel so worked up
over the thing if I could make any sort of guess as to
what it was all about."</p>

<p>"Well," laughed Matt, repeating one of McGlory's favorite
remarks, "we can't know so much all the time as
we do just some part of the time, Joe."</p>

<p>"No more we can't, pard," said the cowboy.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">BETWEEN THE EYES.</p>


<p>The wagon road which the boys were following led
them into Catskill near the railroad station. The motorcycle
tracks, after holding a straight course toward town
for a long time, had finally vanished at an elevated point
from which the motor boys had secured their first view of
the river.</p>

<p>"We might just as well call on the superintendent,"
suggested Matt, when they were close to the station, "and
explain about the speeder. By doing this now, we may
dodge trouble later."</p>

<p>"Good idea," assented McGlory.</p>

<p>They found the superintendent in his office, and he
gave them an immediate hearing.</p>

<p>"We called to tell you about that speeder, Mr. Bronson,"
began Matt, having caught the super's name off
the painted window in the door.</p>

<p>"You mean Mulvaney's speeder," returned Bronson,
"the one that was stolen two days ago?"</p>

<p>"Yes. My name's King, Matt King, and I'm stopping
at the&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Motor Matt?" interrupted Bronson, whirling squarely
around in his swivel chair. He had suddenly developed a
great interest in the interview.</p>

<p>"Yes," laughed Matt, "I'm called that more often than
I'm called by my last name. This is my chum, Joe McGlory,"
and he nodded toward the cowboy.</p>

<p>"I've heard of both of you," smiled Bronson. "That
was great business of yours, over near Purling. But
what in the world have you got to tell me about the
stolen speeder?"</p>

<p>"Then you haven't heard about what happened this
morning?"</p>

<p>"Haven't heard a thing about the speeder to-day.
Why?"</p>

<p>"Well, Joe and I and another fellow were chasing down
a grade with it, a few miles out of town, and a section
gang from Tannersville saw us coming and put a tie
across the rails."</p>

<p>"That stopped you, did it?"</p>

<p>"Did it!" echoed McGlory. "Why, it stopped us so
hard and quick that one of the passengers was scattered
all over the right of way."</p>

<p>"We hadn't anything to do with stealing the machine,"
went on Matt, "and we didn't&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Of course not!" struck in Bronson. "But where did
you get it, and what were you doing with it?"</p>

<p>"You heard how the great ruby was recovered, and
how the thieves got away?"</p>

<p>The superintendent's eyes sparkled.</p>

<p>"Everybody around here has heard about that," he
answered.</p>

<p>"We thought we had a chance to capture one of the
thieves," proceeded Matt. "The crook's pal came to us
and offered to show us where Grattan was, and when we
joined the fellow this morning, he had the speeder tucked
away among the bushes. We knew the speeder had been
stolen, and were intending to bring it back as soon as we
had finished our work; but the section gang made things
so warm for us we had to change our plans."</p>

<p>"And now you're fretting for fear the section men
will send in word, and that I'll have you pinched!"
laughed the superintendent. "I guess I'd think twice before
I had Motor Matt arrested for stealing an old
speeder like that. Mulvaney, our track inspector, made it
himself. He's rather choice of it, and that's why I sent
out word to have the thing found, if possible. But, tell
me, did you capture Grattan?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. We found where he has been staying, but
he had got away before we reached the place."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hard luck! By the way, they've got a moving picture
in one of the nickelodeons here, that tells the story
of a ruby called 'Buddha's Eye.' Everybody is going to
see it. Is that the same story as the one connected with
the 'Eye of Buddha?'"</p>

<p>"It's the same, Mr. Bronson, even down to the minor
detail of the identity of the thieves."</p>

<p>Bronson whistled.</p>

<p>"How in the dickens does that happen, eh?" he asked.</p>

<p>Matt could see no harm in explaining that point, as
Bunce had covered it, and told how the thieves, needing
money in Chicago, had suggested the idea for the picture,
and how at least one of them had volunteered to
play a leading part.</p>

<p>The superintendent was astounded at the audacity of a
thief who, after perpetrating such a successful robbery,
and with the ruby then in his possession, could publish his
crime through the medium of a moving picture.</p>

<p>"It merely goes to prove," said the superintendent,
"what a clever and daring scoundrel this fellow Grattan
is. Too bad he escaped at the time the ruby was so
cleverly recovered. More than likely, Motor Matt, he'll
make trouble for you."</p>

<p>"I guess he'll be too busy looking out for himself,"
laughed Matt, "to pay any attention to me."</p>

<p>"I hope so, certainly."</p>

<p>Matt and McGlory got up to leave.</p>

<p>"Don't bother your head about the speeder," the superintendent
went on. "I'm glad your report reached me
ahead of the one from the section gang. I'll know how
to handle the matter, now, when I hear from the section
boss. Good-by, my lads, and good luck to you."</p>

<p>"It didn't take long to fix that up," said McGlory, when
he and Matt were once more on their way to the hotel.</p>

<p>"I knew it wouldn't," returned Matt, "just as soon as
we could get to some one who would be willing to take
our word for what happened."</p>

<p>"What the super said about Grattan trying to get back
at you, Matt, for what you did in the old sugar camp,
near Purling, sounded to me like it had a lot of good
horse sense mixed up in it."</p>

<p>"What I told the super had a little horse sense in it,
too, didn't it, Joe?"</p>

<p>"You mean about Grattan having so much to do to
keep out of the clutches of the law that he won't find
any time to hit up your trail?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I don't know about that. Grattan is a tinhorn who is
in a class all by himself. He seems to have all kinds of
nerve, and to be willing to take all sorts of chances.
That moving-picture deal gives us a pretty good line on
him."</p>

<p>When the boys got to the hotel, McGlory stumbled
into a chair on the veranda.</p>

<p>"Gee, man, but I'm tired!" he exclaimed. "A cowboy
is built for riding, and not for this footwork. It sure
gets me going. Sit down here for a while, Matt, and
let's palaver about New York, and what the chances are
for our getting there."</p>

<p>"They're pretty slim, I guess," answered Matt, dropping
into a seat at his chum's side, "if we're to wait until
Grattan is captured. Tsan Ti says, in his letter, that
he won't come on until Grattan is behind the bars, or
safely off his trail."</p>

<p>"Which means to hang on here until&mdash;we don't know
when. We're rid of Bunce, but there'll be something
else to hit us between the eyes before we're many minutes
older. You can bet your moccasins on that. As long as
we're tangled up with that ruby, we'll find hard luck
flagging us all along the pike."</p>

<p>At that moment the clerk emerged from the hotel office
and crossed the veranda. He wore a troubled look, as
though something had happened to worry him.</p>

<p>"That man came, Motor Matt," said he, "and I gave
him the box."</p>

<p>McGlory fell back as though some one had struck him.</p>

<p>"What man? What box?" he roused up to inquire
wildly.</p>

<p>The clerk caught the alarm in the cowboy's voice and
manner.</p>

<p>"Why, don't you know?" he cried, appealing to Matt.
"It was the small box you left with me early this morning."</p>

<p>"And&mdash;and you gave it up?" gasped McGlory huskily.</p>

<p>"What else could I do?" protested the clerk. "I had
the written order from Motor Matt. The man brought
it."</p>

<p>McGlory was too dazed to answer. His jaw fell, and
he stared at the king of the motor boys.</p>

<p>"Let me see the order," said Matt.</p>

<p>The clerk pulled a letter from his pocket.</p>

<p>"I hope there's nothing wrong?" he asked, handing the
letter to Matt. "I've been thinking there might be something
wrong, but I didn't see how there could be. The
handwriting of that letter matches your fist on the register&mdash;I
was careful to look that up before I gave the man
the box."</p>

<p>"Read it, pard," implored McGlory, in a mechanical
tone.</p>

<p>"'Please deliver to bearer the small box which I left
with you for safe-keeping, early this morning,'" Matt
read. "'I need it at once, and find that I can't come for
it in person.' That's all of it, Joe," said Matt, "and I
must say that it's a pretty good imitation of my handwriting.
The name is a tremendously good forgery."</p>

<p>The clerk nearly threw a fit; and McGlory nearly
helped him.</p>

<p>"Then the letter is a forgery?" cried the clerk. "The
man didn't have any right to the box?"</p>

<p>"How could he have any right to the box," stormed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
McGlory, "when the letter asking you to turn it over to
him was never written by Motor Matt? Corral your wits.
Sufferin' hold-ups, it's come! We no sooner get out of
one raw deal, than we tumble headfirst into another.
Now&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Take it easy, Joe," cut in Matt. "Wait a minute."
He turned to the clerk. "Don't get worked up about
this," said he; "you're not to blame. When did the man
call and deliver the forged letter?"</p>

<p>"Not more than an hour ago," answered the clerk,
wiping the perspiration from his forehead. "Was there
anything very valuable in the box?"</p>

<p>"What sort of looking man was he?" proceeded Matt.</p>

<p>"Slim, and dark, and undersized. Fairly well dressed."</p>

<p>"Well, never mind. Don't let it worry you."</p>

<p>The clerk, visibly distressed, in spite of Matt's reassuring
words, went back into the office. As soon as he had
vanished inside the hotel, the king of the motor boys gave
vent to a low laugh.</p>

<p>McGlory peered at him.</p>

<p>"Pard!" he murmured, leaning over to drop a hand on
Matt's knee. "Have you gone off the jump on account
of that confounded ruby? It's a blow between the eyes,
all right, but, for heaven's sake, don't let it get you
locoed."</p>

<p>"Locoed!" and Matt pulled himself together, reached
inside his vest and brought out a knotted handkerchief.
Untying the knotted ends of the handkerchief, he opened
it out on his knee. "See here, Joe!" said he; "that's how
badly I am locoed."</p>

<p>What McGlory saw was the ruby, glowing redly
against the white linen.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">THE MAN FROM THE "IRIS."</p>


<p>Not many times in McGlory's life had he been so tremendously
at a loss for words as he was then. He
stared at the ruby and he stared at Matt.</p>

<p>"You see, pard," said Matt, "the ruby wasn't in the
box when I gave it to the clerk. I kept the Eye of Buddha
safely about me, all the time. It gouged me a little when
the speeder stopped and I was slammed against the forward
bench."</p>

<p>"Speak to me about this!" rumbled the cowboy. "It
wasn't in the box&mdash;a tinhorn blew in with a forged letter&mdash;he
got the box, but he didn't get the ruby. Matt's done
something&mdash;and he never told me what he was doing.
What&mdash;how&mdash;why&mdash;&mdash; Look here, you blooming old
maverick, how did you ever come to think of such a
dodge?"</p>

<p>"It wasn't much of a dodge," answered Matt. "In the
first place, I didn't take any stock in that wild yarn told
us by Bunce. At the same time, while I didn't believe in
it, I couldn't afford not to go with Bunce on Tsan Ti's
account. I tried to think why Bunce should want to coax
us into the hills, and the only idea that came to me had
to do with the ruby. Now, I reasoned, if the ruby <i>was</i>
back of Bunce's little game, then it was clear he knew it
had been sent to me for safe-keeping. I wanted to find
just how much Bunce knew, so I left the box with the
clerk. Bunce was watching, or else he had somebody else
watching. If he'd thought I had the ruby with me, an
attempt would have been made to get it while we were in
the hills. But Bunce believed I had left the ruby in the
safe, so he dodged away, leaving you and me to be nabbed
by the section men, while he went on to that 'pocket'
under the ledge, found Grattan, told him where I had
placed the box, and the two got on their motorcycles
and came close enough to town to get a man to help them
secure the box.</p>

<p>"Grattan must have forged the letter. Then this third
man took it. The rascals had to work quick, for
the game was played while we were taking a look around
at the camp in the ravine, and walking into town. Can't
you understand, Joe? By getting us into the hills, with
that fairy story about Tsan Ti, Grattan could play his
hand either way. If we had the ruby with us, he could
get hold of it; if we had left it behind, he could take advantage
of our absence from Catskill to execute some ruse
in town while we were out in the country."</p>

<p>"Clever?" breathed McGlory; "why, he's the cleverest
crook that ever happened. But I'd like to have a picture
of him now!" The cowboy fell back in his seat and
roared with mirth. "Wouldn't I like to look in on him
while he and Bunce are opening that box?" he sputtered.
"Oh, but it's rich! Clever as he is, Grattan has found
that he's butted up against some one who can give him
cards and spades, and then beat him out. I've been
proud of you, pard, more times than I can tell, but I'm
just a little prouder now than I ever was before. Shake!"</p>

<p>Matt caught his chum's hand.</p>

<p>"It was only a guess, Joe," he deprecated, "and it happened
to work our way. There was nothing clever about
what I did. The result was entirely a&mdash;an accident."</p>

<p>"You had your head with you, all the same," insisted
McGlory, "when you put that empty box in the safe. But
how in thunder did Bunce get next to that? How did
he know that Tsan Ti had sent you the ruby, in the first
place?"</p>

<p>"Well, he did know, and that's enough. A third man
has jumped into the deal&mdash;another pal, who is helping
Grattan and Bunce. Perhaps he had something to do
with keeping track of the ruby."</p>

<p>"Perhaps. But that old two-eyed counterfeit with the
green patch&mdash;I wonder how much he'd sell out for, about
now?"</p>

<p>"Bunce is pretty clever, in his own way, too," averred
Matt. "He must have laughed in his sleeve when he saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
how we had swallowed that fish story of his about Tsan
Ti."</p>

<p>"He can laugh, now, on t'other side of his face. We're
helping Tsan Ti, all right. Grattan is on our trail instead
of his. I'm not saying it was the right thing for
the mandarin to shift the responsibility for that ruby onto
you, but he was pretty long headed when he did it. He
understood that if any one could take care of the ruby
it was Motor Matt."</p>

<p>"It will soon be dinner time, Joe," said Matt. "Suppose
we go up to our room, shake the dust out of our
clothes, take a bath, and get ready to eat?"</p>

<p>"That reminds me how hungry I am!" exclaimed McGlory,
springing up.</p>

<p>By the time dinner was ready, the boys were ready for
dinner. Their experiences of the forenoon had put a
keen edge on their appetite, and the cowboy was in high
good humor.</p>

<p>He and Matt had put in a strenuous morning, and so
long as McGlory thought they had not accomplished anything,
he was disgusted and "out of sorts." But to learn
that Grattan and Bunce had been beaten at their own
game, set twanging a most delightful chord in the cowboy's
make-up.</p>

<p>The motor boys had no plans for the afternoon, so they
put in their time idling about the veranda. It was about
three o'clock when a tall man, dressed in a natty white
yachting costume with the name "Iris," in gilt letters on
the band of his cap, came briskly up the veranda steps,
passed Matt and McGlory and went on into the hotel.</p>

<p>The man claimed only casual attention, on his first
appearance, but, a few seconds later, he captured the entire
attention of the two boys. He returned to the veranda,
ushered by the clerk, and both stepped toward Motor
Matt.</p>

<p>"Matt," said the clerk, "this is Mr. Pardo, of the yacht
<i>Iris</i>. Mr. Pardo, Mr. King. He wants to see you about
some business matter," the clerk added, as he vanished
back into the hotel.</p>

<p>The man from the <i>Iris</i> smiled cordially as he clasped
Matt's hand.</p>

<p>"This is a pleasure, I assure you," said Pardo. "I
have heard quite a little about Motor Matt."</p>

<p>"What can I do for you, Mr. Pardo?" asked Matt.</p>

<p>"That's the business part of our interview," was the
answer, as Pardo helped himself to a chair, "and I'm
going to get right down to it. You are familiar with
gasoline motors, I understand?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"With marine motors?"</p>

<p>"I reckon you never heard how he put an automobile
engine in a launch, at Madison, Wisconsin," struck in
McGlory, "and won a big race. He's right at home with
every kind of an explosive engine, whether it drives a
craft in the air, on wheels, or in the water."</p>

<p>"My chum is a trifle prejudiced, Mr. Pardo," smiled
Matt.</p>

<p>"Well, I guess you can do the work, all right. The
question now is, can I secure your services?"</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"Of course," laughed Pardo, "that's what you naturally
want to know. I'm the owner of a power yacht, fifty
feet over all, ten feet beam, equipped with a fifty-horse-power
motor. She's the <i>Iris</i>. I dropped down from Albany,
this afternoon, and when we tied up at Catskill my
engineer received a telegram from Buffalo saying that
his father was dangerously sick. He left at once, and
here I am, anxious to make a quick run to New York,
but caught in the worst kind of a hole. Can't I get you
to help me out? As soon as I reach New York I can get
any number of reliable men to take charge of my engine
room, but here in Catskill help of that sort is scarce."</p>

<p>McGlory's joy shone in his face. Here was a chance to
get down the river in style, and all that stood between
Matt and the trip was the ruby.</p>

<p>"Can't you run the motor, Mr. Pardo?" asked Matt.</p>

<p>"Don't know the first thing about it," was the answer.
"You see, I haven't had time to learn. This is my first
trip in the <i>Iris</i>, and I haven't had much chance to pick
up a knowledge of her machinery. It's my idea that every
man ought to know how to run his own boat&mdash;and I'll
know it, too, before I'm many days older. But, just now,
I've got to have some one. What do you say?"</p>

<p>Pardo noticed that Matt was not especially eager to
help him out.</p>

<p>"If you can just get me down to New York," he
pleaded, "that's all I will ask. If you have to come back
to Catskill for anything, you can come on the train in
the morning. You won't be away very long, and it will
be a big accommodation to me. I'll pay you well for
your trouble, too, if that will be any inducement."</p>

<p>"Better go, pard," urged McGlory. "I don't think your
business will suffer any. We can be back here by nine in
the morning, if we want to."</p>

<p>It was hardly likely, as Matt reasoned the matter out,
that Tsan Ti would present himself and ask for the ruby
before he and McGlory could get back from New York.
The opportunity to make a little money in a pleasant way
was appealing, for the king of the motor boys had long
desired to have the run of the engine room on a big power
boat.</p>

<p>"What time do you want to start, Mr. Pardo?" Matt
asked.</p>

<p>"At nine, this evening," was the reply. "If you can
help me out, you'd better arrange to be aboard at, say,
eight-thirty. The <i>Iris</i> is close to the day-line dock, and
you can't help but find her."</p>

<p>"How much are you willing to pay for the trip?"
queried Matt. "It's just as well, you know, to have all
that settled beforehand."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll give you a hundred dollars&mdash;not so much for the
work, you understand, as for the time you are losing.
Your time may be worth even more than that. If it
is&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You are more than liberal," broke in Matt. "I and
my chum will be aboard the <i>Iris</i> at eight-thirty."</p>

<p>The man from the <i>Iris</i> heaved a deep breath.</p>

<p>"That's a big load off my mind," said he. "I could
have telegraphed New York and had an engineer come
up on a late train&mdash;but that would have delayed the start
until close upon midnight. I shall expect you, Motor
Matt," and Pardo got up and went his way briskly.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">ABOARD THE STEAM YACHT.</p>


<p>"I don't know," said Matt, "whether this is the thing
for us to do, or not, Joe. Tsan Ti's letter asked us to
stay in the Catskills."</p>

<p>"Oh, bother the old heathen!" returned the cowboy.
"He won't show up here for quite a spell. Anyhow, if
he does arrive to-morrow morning, before we do, he can
wait for us, can't he?"</p>

<p>"He's paying us for our time."</p>

<p>"What if he is, pard? The old boy won't find any
fault if we take this little run down the river. There's
a point, too, that you don't seem to have thought of."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"Why, Grattan has quit trailing Tsan Ti and gone to
trailing you. By taking this trip down the river we may
be able to throw Grattan off the track."</p>

<p>"That's so," answered Matt, struck with the idea.</p>

<p>"If the tinhorn is laying any more of his plans," chuckled
the cowboy, "we'll fool him."</p>

<p>"I'll leave word with the clerk," said Matt, "to tell
Tsan Ti where we've gone, and when we'll return; then,
if he <i>does</i> happen to get here before we do, he'll know
we're intending to come back and meet him."</p>

<p>"That's the talk!"</p>

<p>Matt immediately went into the hotel and stepped to
the clerk's desk.</p>

<p>"Are you acquainted with Mr. Pardo?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Never saw him before," answered the clerk. "He
came in here, introduced himself, and said he was looking
for Motor Matt. I knew you were on the porch, so I
volunteered to take him out and introduce you. Looks
like a fine gentleman. Interview satisfactory?"</p>

<p>"Yes. He has a power yacht at the landing, and wants
an engineer to get her to New York for him. I've taken
the job, and Joe and I will be away all night and not get
back until sometime to-morrow forenoon. If any one
calls and asks for me, you need not tell them where I have
gone, but just let them know when I expect to return."</p>

<p>"I'll do it, Matt. Didn't know you had an engineer's
license?"</p>

<p>"He's got everything," put in McGlory, "that goes with
running a motor."</p>

<p>The boys had no preparations to make, and as there
were two hours to be passed before supper they concluded
to run down to the dock and take a look at the
<i>Iris</i>. There was no difficulty at all in locating her, and
the sight of her trim and graceful lines made Matt eager
to have a look at her interior plan. There was no one
about her decks, however, whom he and McGlory could
hail, and he hesitated to go aboard and arouse any one
who might chance to be in the cabin.</p>

<p>The cowboy, who was a wretched sailor, quite unaccountably
was an enthusiast about boats, and his doting
eyes sparkled as they traveled over the <i>Iris</i>.</p>

<p>She had a very high freeboard forward, and this, with
her perfect lines, gave her an easy entrance and a guarantee
that she would not pound or ship seas in any sort
of weather. There was no midship bridge, or forward
pilot house, but the boat was steered and the engine controlled
from a big and roomy after deck.</p>

<p>"She's a fair daisy!" declared the cowboy, "as spick
and span as a freshly coined four-bit piece. Sufferin'
bones, but I'd like to own a boat like that!"</p>

<p>"You'd find such a craft an expensive luxury, Joe,"
said Matt. "If you did much cruising, it would keep you
poor just buying gasoline. Let's go back up the hill. We
can't see inside the boat, and it don't take long to get a
pretty fair idea of the outside."</p>

<p>Returning to the hotel, the boys idled away the time
until the supper call sounded. The meal over, there were
still some two hours of waiting before they were due
aboard the <i>Iris</i>.</p>

<p>McGlory suggested another visit to the theatre for a
second look at the "Buddha's Eye" pictures. Matt, thinking
that as good a way as any for passing the time, acquiesced,
and they were soon at the moving-picture place.</p>

<p>There was standing room only&mdash;which proved how
much of a hit the ruby robbery had made. The hit, of
course, was entirely because of Matt's adventures while
recovering the gem for Tsan Ti. If those attending the
show had known that Motor Matt was also present, and
that he had the very Eye of Buddha in his pocket, there
would have followed a furore of no small proportions.</p>

<p>But the king of the motor boys, often in direct opposition
to his best interests, was reserved and diffident.</p>

<p>"Gee!" exclaimed the cowboy, as he and Matt left the
theatre and wandered along the street, "if those people
back there had only known who you were, and what you
had in your pocket, there'd have been something of a
stir."</p>

<p>"I don't like that kind of a stir," said Matt.</p>

<p>"That's you! Say, pard, you're altogether too modest
and retiring. If you wanted to splurge a little, you could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
make yourself talked about from one end of the country
to the other."</p>

<p>"I'll leave that to those who like it. It's the quiet chap,
who plugs along and does things without blowing his
own horn who makes the biggest hit in the end."</p>

<p>"I don't know but that's right, too."</p>

<p>They dropped in at another show, promenaded the
street, and finally discovered that it was nearly eight-thirty.
Turning their steps toward the water front, they
presently reached the wharf alongside the <i>Iris</i>.</p>

<p>The craft had her "running" lights in position. There
was a white light in the bow, visible from straight ahead
and for ten points on either side, a green light to starboard
and a red light to port, each screened so that it
could be seen from dead ahead to two points aft of the
beam, and a high white light aft and directly over the
keel, showing all around the horizon.</p>

<p>But, notwithstanding all these lights on deck, there
were none visible through the cabin ports.</p>

<p>"I wonder if Mr. Pardo has got here?" said Matt.</p>

<p>"What's the odds, Matt?" returned McGlory. "It's
eight-thirty, and we're due."</p>

<p>They got aboard, gaining the after deck. The elevated
white light cast a dim glow over polished mahogany and
glittering brasswork, and Matt bent down to examine the
bulkhead controls. A door opened in the bulkhead, on
the right of the steering wheel, and a man showed shadowily
in the dark.</p>

<p>"Is that Motor Matt?" he called.</p>

<p>"Yes," was the reply.</p>

<p>The man clambered up two or three steps, knocking his
shins and swearing because of the darkness.</p>

<p>"You're expected," said he. "Go down into the saloon&mdash;a
stateroom is the first thing you come to, and the
saloon is beyond that."</p>

<p>"Why don't you light up?" asked Matt.</p>

<p>"Mr. Pardo has a headache, and the light bothers him.
Go on down&mdash;he's waiting for you."</p>

<p>Matt led the way, and McGlory followed. They left
the door open, and a faint radiance followed them, but
they were in unfamiliar surroundings, and had to grope
their way along.</p>

<p>"Is that you, Motor Matt?" called a voice, which they
recognized as Pardo's.</p>

<p>"Yes," Matt answered.</p>

<p>"Come on in here. I'm not feeling very well to-night,
and the light hurts my eyes. You can guide yourself by
the sound of my voice, can't you?"</p>

<p>"We'll get there, all right."</p>

<p>"Is your friend with you?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I never travel without him."</p>

<p>The next moment Matt gained the open door in another
bulkhead. Before he could pass through it, two
sinewy arms went around him from behind and a hand
was clapped over his lips. He struggled, but he was
caught as in a vise, and his efforts to free himself were
useless. From near at hand, too, he heard sounds which
indicated that McGlory, also, had been seized.</p>

<p>"Got them?" came the voice of Pardo.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," answered the man who was holding Matt,
"but they're fightin' like a pair o' young demons."</p>

<p>"Then throw them down on the side seats and hold
pillows over their heads. We'll get under way at once."</p>

<p>Matt felt himself borne down on a cushioned bench.
The hand was jerked from his lips, and the half-formed
cry that escaped him was smothered in the pillow that
was immediately pushed over his head.</p>

<p>A bell jingled, and steps could be heard on the deck
above, moving swiftly.</p>

<p>"All right!" came a muffled voice.</p>

<p>Matt, half suffocated, could hear no more. He was
fighting fiercely for his breath.</p>

<p>Presently he was conscious that the <i>Iris</i> was moving,
and, as he lay gasping and helpless under the strong
hands of his captor, there came faintly to his ears the
hum of a motor and the lapping of waves against the
hull.</p>

<p>How long he was held down on the seat, half smothered
by the pillow, he did not know. It seemed hours,
but was probably no more than so many minutes.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, the pillow was jerked away, and he
lifted himself on his elbow, a glare of light in his eyes.
For a moment or two the dazzling light blinded him.
When his eyes became somewhat used to it, he discovered
a man standing near him, his flannel shirt parted at the
throat and his bronzed arms bare to the elbows. The
man held a dirk in one hand and a piece of rope in the
other.</p>

<p>From this frowning figure, Matt's gaze shifted across
the narrow aisle to a cushioned bench opposite. McGlory
was there, and there was likewise a ruffian keeping
watch of him.</p>

<p>"What&mdash;what does this mean?" demanded Matt.</p>

<p>"You'll find out, quick enough. Are you goin' to make
any trouble? If you are, say so, now, and you'll save
yourself a knife in the ribs."</p>

<p>"I want to know about this!" declared Matt.</p>

<p>"Then get up and go into the saloon."</p>

<p>"You, too," said the man who had charge of McGlory.
"Foller yer mate inter the saloon, an' if either o'
ye let out a yell ye'll never know what struck you."</p>

<p>Matt, fearing the worst, swung his feet down from the
upholstered seat and started forward. McGlory, who
appeared to be in a trance, followed him mechanically.</p>

<p>The door of the saloon was open, and Matt passed
through it, and stopped. McGlory crowded in beside him.</p>

<p>The saloon was the full width of the boat, with seats
on each side, and a table at one end. The small room was
flooded with light, and three figures were seen in an
angle formed by one of the seats where it partly crossed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
the forward bulkhead. The fixed table stood in the angle,
and the three figures were leaning upon it.</p>

<p>One of the men was Grattan, another was Bunce, and
the third was Pardo. In front of Grattan, on the table
top, lay two objects. One was a revolver, and the other
the small box in which the ruby had been expressed to
Matt from New York.</p>

<p>All three of the men were smiling.</p>

<p>"Speak to me about this!" muttered McGlory.
"Nabbed! Nabbed as slick as you please! And I never
guessed a thing. Oh, sufferin' easy marks!"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">GRATTAN'S TRIUMPH.</p>


<p>Motor Matt understood the situation. The full realization
came to him with something like a shock. In some
way Grattan had secured the aid of the owner and crew
of the <i>Iris</i> in carrying out his villainous designs. He had
triumphed, for he had only to have Matt searched in
order to secure the ruby.</p>

<p>Philo Grattan was an educated fellow, and could be
a man of pleasing address when he so desired. In almost
any honest line of work he could have distinguished himself,
for his ability was high above the average. Yet,
like so many others equally gifted, he had been drawn
toward a life of crime.</p>

<p>"Motor Matt," said he, in a tone and with a manner
that was friendly, "we meet again. The pleasure, on your
part, I presume, is unexpected, and perhaps of a doubtful
quality, but so far as I am concerned, I assure you that
this renewing of our acquaintance leaves nothing to be
desired."</p>

<p>"Not a blessed thing," struck in Bunce, contorted with
inward mirth, "sink me, if it does!"</p>

<p>Grattan dropped a heavy hand on the mariner's
shoulder.</p>

<p>"Keep a still tongue in your head," he ordered sternly.
"I'm able to do the talking."</p>

<p>"Then," and Matt turned toward Pardo, "this is simply
a plot you have engineered to get me into the hands
of Grattan?"</p>

<p>"Simply and solely," was Pardo's cheerful answer.</p>

<p>"Pardo is my friend," explained Grattan. "He lives in
Albany, when he's at home&mdash;but he's rarely at home. He
has been fortunate, of late, in sundry little ventures, and
happened to be well supplied with money. No sooner
had I lost my buckthorn cane, there in the old sugar
camp, at Purling, and been made aware of the fact that
the Eye of Buddha had been found, than I communicated
with friend Pardo. I had met him in Albany on
my way to the Catskills, so I knew he was at home. He
met me in my temporary camp, and agreed to charter the
<i>Iris</i> to help me down the river and out of the country
after I had got back the ruby. The <i>Iris</i>, together with a
crew of men on whom we can depend, has been awaiting
my convenience for the past two days. Of course,"
and Grattan showed his teeth in a smile, "my friend's
name is not Pardo, any more than mine is Grattan, or
than this salt-water bungler on my left is named Bunce."</p>

<p>Although Matt followed Grattan closely, he had, at the
same time, been covertly using his eyes.</p>

<p>The door leading into the stateroom behind him was
closed. On the other side of it he knew there was one
brawny ruffian, and perhaps two. Beyond the saloon's
forward bulkhead he could hear the purring motor.
There, he inferred, was the engine room and the galley,
with another man who could be "depended on." At the
steering and engine controls on the after deck was surely
another man, and probably one on the deck overhead.</p>

<p>He and McGlory were hemmed in on all sides. There
must have been, counting those in the saloon, all of seven
or eight men against them. So far as Matt could see, the
case was hopeless.</p>

<p>Matt's covert looks had not escaped the keen eyes of
Grattan. The scoundrel seemed able to read even the
young motorist's thoughts.</p>

<p>"Don't think of escape, Motor Matt," said he. "That is
entirely out of the question. Neither you nor your friend
are in any danger. I think too highly of you to rob the
world of so much talent and ingenuity. Let us have another
friendly and intimate chat such as we had in the
old sugar camp. I do not object to telling you things of
great moment to me, because I have already taken measures
to make the knowledge harmless. I escaped from
the sugar camp, did I not? And all I told you then did
not in any way hamper me in proceeding with my plans.
I am willing to be equally frank now, in the hope that
you, on your part, will give me some of your confidence.</p>

<p>"You thought Tsan Ti, the mandarin, had started for
San Francisco with the ruby. Orientals are crafty. He
gave it out that he was going to San Francisco, and immediately
started for New York. I had him followed
from the Hotel Kaaterskill, and shadowed while in New
York. The man who served me was clever, but not
clever enough to keep Tsan Ti from learning that he was
under espionage. The mandarin became nervous. He
did not appeal to the police, as his heathen mind counsels
him to have nothing to do with the peace officers who
serve the foreign devils. But he had his man, Sam Wing,
and other Chinamen, continually guard him. One of
these Chinamen was faithless. Some of my money, expended
by the man I had set to watch Tsan Ti, bought
him. This Chinaman was Charley Foo, and he betrayed
the mandarin's trust for the sum of ten silver dollars.</p>

<p>"Charley was in the room with Tsan Ti when the ruby
was boxed, wrapped and addressed to Motor Matt. Charley,
also, went with Tsan Ti and Sam Wing to the express
office, and saw the package sent. Then, quite naturally,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
Charley told my man, and my man telegraphed
Pardo at Hudson, and Pardo got the message to me, out
there in that lonely ravine.</p>

<p>"Then I began rehearsing Bunce in his part. Bunce is
a natural blockhead, and I was three hours teaching him
what he was to say and do. As an example of his folly,
I will say that it was Bunce who stole the speeder. The
owner of the machine was inspecting a bit of siding that
wound around a low hill. The speeder was on the main
track. All Bunce had to do was to get aboard, switch
on the gasoline and the spark&mdash;and there you are. But
why did we need the speeder when we had two good
motorcycles? Bunce can't tell. He doesn't know. He
has a low mind, and the itch to steal unimportant things
runs in his blood&mdash;and has more than once proved embarrassing
to me.</p>

<p>"However, I saw a chance to use the speeder in beguiling
you to my ravine. The motorcycles would only
have carried two, and there were to be three of you, including
Bunce. Besides, the machines might have aroused
your suspicions. So the speeder was used, and Pardo
went over the hill with Bunce and helped him hide the
speeder within an arrow flight of the Catskill railroad
yards.</p>

<p>"Bunce took a risk. He knew it. I impressed upon him
the fact that, if he did not carry out his programme with
earnestness, you would make a prisoner of him and turn
him over to the police. We knew Tsan Ti had written
that you must keep the ruby about you, and leave it nowhere
for security. I flattered myself you would bring
the gem with you, concealed somewhere upon your person.
But Pardo, wearing clothes which made him look
vastly different, saw you leave the little box with the hotel
clerk. Instantly Pardo ran ahead of you to the place
where Bunce was waiting, and told him. The seeming
failure of our plans threw Bunce into a panic&mdash;you can
expect so little of Bunce in a pinch!&mdash;and he would have
thrown over the whole matter, then and there, had not
Pardo advised him. 'Take them out into the hills,' said
Pardo, 'and leave them stranded there while you get
away to the ravine and tell Grattan. Grattan will know
what to do.' And Grattan did."</p>

<p>An ironical smile crossed the face of the strange man,
and he paused a space. When he continued, his manner
was again easy and vivacious.</p>

<p>"Ah, those section men! They helped gain time for
me, and afforded Bunce his opportunity to get away from
you. Bunce fled&mdash;you know how. He came to me and
told me about the box, the box Motor Matt had left with
the hotel clerk to be put in the safe. A fountain pen and
a sheet of letter paper sufficed for the letter. I have seen
your written name, Motor Matt, and when I have once
seen a person's handwriting, I can copy it from memory
after a lapse of one year or ten. Some say it is a gift.</p>

<p>"We had sharp work ahead of us, Bunce and I. We
rolled out of the ravine on our motorcycles, gained the
river bank below Catskill and signaled the <i>Iris</i>. Pardo
came ashore in the tender, and he loaned us his motor-man
for the work that claimed us. You know how he
got the box, and we know what it contained&mdash;cotton
wadding, but no ruby. Motor Matt, I could have shaken
your hand and congratulated you&mdash;if you had been near
and I had had time.</p>

<p>"A few rebuffs are what I need to bring out the best
that is in me. Quick as a flash I thought of the motor-man's sick
father in Buffalo, and Pardo's call at your
hotel to get you to take the <i>Iris</i> to New York. Shall I
call it an inspiration? I believe it amounted to that.</p>

<p>"Bunce and I, snugged away in this saloon, slept and
waited for the issue of our scheming. Pardo came to report
that you would be aboard the <i>Iris</i> at eight-thirty. I
was almost sure of success, but not certain. You have a
way, Motor Matt, of disappointing people like me, and I
was not counting positively upon success until I had you
in my hands.</p>

<p>"Well, here you are. I have only the kindliest feelings
toward you, but you know what I want, and what I want,
in this instance, I am going to have."</p>

<p>Grattan got up and stood beside the table, a superb
figure of a man whose head just cleared the deck above.</p>

<p>"I have devoted time, and study, and faced dangers innumerable,"
he proceeded, betrayed into passionate vehemence,
"to secure the Eye of Buddha! I have beaten
down every obstacle, and secured the stone only to lose it;
now it is mine again, mine. Motor Matt," and he
stretched out his hand, "I will trouble you for the Eye of
Buddha!"</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">FROM THE OPEN PORT!</p>


<p>Motor Matt made no move to give the ruby into the
possession of Grattan. Thief though he was, yet Philo
Grattan had a remarkable personality. Matt had listened
to him with deepest interest, but one hand had been busy
in his pocket. McGlory was so deeply absorbed in what
the master rogue was saying that his jaws gaped, and he
hung breathlessly upon his words.</p>

<p>Near Matt's left hand, with only the width of the side
seat between, was an open port.</p>

<p>"What!" exclaimed Grattan, as though intensely surprised,
"you hesitate? I dislike to treat you with any
more roughness, Motor Matt. It seems to me you might
understand how hopeless it is for you to try to keep the
ruby. What is this Tsan Ti to you that you will risk so
much for him? Is it the money he pays you? I can't believe
that. You have made a good deal of money in your
work, I have been told, and you are not in need.</p>

<p>"Is it because you desire to help an unfortunate Chinaman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
who must use the yellow cord in case he cannot return
to China with the Eye of Buddha? Foolish sentiment!
What would this fat mandarin of the red button
do for you if your positions were reversed? Take the
present case. What has Tsan Ti done? He is a coward.
Instead of facing his risks like a man, he turns the ruby
over to you, thereby unloading the danger and responsibility.
After you have me safely jailed"&mdash;and Grattan's
voice throbbed with contempt and scorn&mdash;"then this mandarin
will hunt you up, take the ruby, which is worth a
fortune, and pay you a thousand dollars! Why are you
the friend of such a coward? Tell me, will you? Here is
where I should like a frank expression of your views."</p>

<p>"I don't think Tsan Ti is a coward," Matt answered.</p>

<p>"You have the proof."</p>

<p>"I have your side of the question, not his."</p>

<p>"My side of the question! Is there any other side?"</p>

<p>"There may be."</p>

<p>"I am disappointed in you, Motor Matt. Such talk is
foolish&mdash;almost worthy of Bunce, here."</p>

<p>"There is something else, too, Grattan," went on Matt,
"something, I suppose, you will appreciate even less than
what I have just said."</p>

<p>"I don't think there can be anything I would appreciate
less. However, let's hear what it is."</p>

<p>"Being true to a trust," answered Matt sturdily. "Even
if a Chinaman trusts you, standing fast and not betraying
his confidence."</p>

<p>Bunce snickered, and Pardo laughed outright. Only
Grattan kept a serious face and peered steadily at Matt.</p>

<p>"Yes," murmured Grattan, "there is something in that.
It is not for me&mdash;I have turned my back on such principles&mdash;but
you are young and quite likely you have
started right. That, however, does not affect our present
situation. It is impossible for you to remain true to the
trust the cowardly Tsan Ti reposes in you. I have you
in my power. It is night, and the <i>Iris</i> is in the middle of
the Hudson River. The ruby is tied up in a handkerchief
in your coat pocket. I tell you I want it."</p>

<p>The voice was imperious, compelling. Motor Matt
still passively faced Grattan.</p>

<p>"Oh, shiver me!" grunted Bunce. "Let's lay hold of
him an' take it."</p>

<p>Pardo pushed a hand toward the revolver on the table.</p>

<p>With one movement, Grattan, although still with his
eyes on Matt, dropped his own hand to the revolver and
another hand on Bunce's shoulder.</p>

<p>"You'll speak when you're spoken to, Bunce," said he
savagely, "and Pardo, you'll leave the revolver alone.
I've managed this matter with fair success, up to now,
and I believe I can wind it up. The ruby, Motor Matt!"</p>

<p>"There it is!" said Matt.</p>

<p>His hand darted toward the open port. A knotted
handkerchief, weighted with some small object, flashed
through the port and vanished downward.</p>

<p>A yell escaped Bunce, and he flung himself across the
table in a frantic attempt to lay hold of Matt. Pardo
leaped for him, and the door leading into the stateroom
opened and the man who was waiting stepped into the
room.</p>

<p>McGlory had jumped to help Matt against Pardo. The
man who had just entered grabbed the cowboy and flung
him roughly on the seat at the side of the room; then he
and Pardo hurled Matt to the floor.</p>

<p>"Search him!" ordered Grattan calmly.</p>

<p>"By the seven holy spritsails!" bellowed Bunce, "what's
the use o' searchin' him? Didn't he just throw the Eye o'
Buddha into the river?"</p>

<p>"He ought to be strangled for that!" cried Pardo, in a
temper.</p>

<p>"Search him, I tell you!" roared Grattan. "Are you all
a pack of fools? He didn't throw the ruby into the
river."</p>

<p>"But we saw him," insisted Pardo.</p>

<p>"You saw his handkerchief go into the river, but it was
only a trick. Do you think he would sacrifice the ruby,
even to prevent me from getting it? Search him, I tell
you."</p>

<p>The search was made, and thoroughly. Motor Matt's
pockets were turned inside out, but without result. Garment
by garment his clothes were stripped away and
crushed in eager hands, but still without result.</p>

<p>The ruby was as large as a small hen's egg, and not
easily to be hidden.</p>

<p>McGlory had gone into a trance again. As he lay on
the seat and stared, he wondered if Matt had really tossed
the priceless gem into the Hudson.</p>

<p>"He hasn't got it, Grattan," announced Pardo.</p>

<p>"Then his friend has it," answered Grattan confidently.
"Search him."</p>

<p>Thereupon the cowboy came in for his share of the
rough handling. Matt once more got into his clothes.
Just as the search of McGlory was finished, Motor Matt
was reaching for his cap, which had tumbled off in the
scuffle in the other room, and had been thrown into the
saloon after the boys had entered it.</p>

<p>"Nothing here," announced Pardo, as he turned from
McGlory.</p>

<p>"Nary, there ain't," fumed McGlory. "Motor Matt's
not the lad to shift his responsibilities like Tsan Ti. Sufferin'
hornets! You're a fine outfit of tinhorns, I must
say."</p>

<p>Stepping quickly out from behind the table, Grattan
passed to Matt and snatched off his cap. He weighed the
cap for a moment in his hand, felt of the crown with his
fingers, and then, still holding the cap, returned quietly to
his seat.</p>

<p>"Sit down, Bunce, you and Pardo," ordered Grattan.
"Pierson, go out and close the door."</p>

<p>When the two men were seated, and after Pierson had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
left the saloon, Grattan leaned his elbows on the table,
Matt's cap between them.</p>

<p>"This Motor Matt," said he, "is a lad whom I greatly
admire. He takes precautions. His first precaution was
removing the ruby from the box and depositing the box
with the hotel clerk before he went out into the hills with
Bunce. In running away from the ravine with Bunce
to carry out my plan for securing the box, I ran directly
away from Motor Matt and the ruby. Motor Matt had
the ruby tied up in his handkerchief, then. He was seen,
on the hotel veranda, to untie his handkerchief and show
the ruby to his friend. When he came aboard the <i>Iris</i>
he had taken another precaution. Something else was
tied up in the handkerchief, and the ruby was in the
lining of his cap."</p>

<p>Swiftly Grattan's hands descended, tore at the cap
lining, and brought out the imperial stone. He laid it on
the table, turning and turning it so the light might catch
its fiery flash.</p>

<p>"Blow me tight!" mumbled Bunce. "Say, mates," he
added, drawing a sleeve across his forehead, "that was a
scare I don't want ever to go through ag'in. We've risked
so much for that bloomin' Eye o' Buddha that I near went
wrong in the head with the thought that it was in the bottom
o' the river!"</p>

<p>"It's comparatively easy for you to go wrong in the
head, Bunce," taunted Grattan.</p>

<p>"So that's the thing!" murmured Pardo, his fascinated
eyes on the gleaming stone.</p>

<p>"Did you ever see anything more beautiful?" asked
Grattan. "It's a true pigeon-blood ruby, and worth ten
times the value of a diamond the same size."</p>

<p>Then, drawing out his own handkerchief, he wrapped
the ruby carefully, and as carefully stowed it away in his
pocket.</p>

<p>"So," said he, "after a number of startling adventures
in the Catskills, the ruby is finally where it ought to be."</p>

<p>"It ought to be in the head of that idol, in Canton,"
said Matt.</p>

<p>The king of the motor boys was calm, and, while he
may have had regrets, he had nothing to reproach himself
for. He had done his best to keep the ruby&mdash;and he had
failed.</p>

<p>"Motor Matt," returned Grattan, "a heathen temple is
no place for such a jewel as this. In the Honan joss
house it benefits no one. When I sell it, it will benefit
me a great deal, and Bunce a little."</p>

<p>"And me," put in Pardo. "Don't forget that I stand in
on the divvy."</p>

<p>"And Pardo," added Grattan.</p>

<p>"And Tsan Ti must strangle himself with the yellow
cord," said Matt.</p>

<p>"If that is his will, yes. I have no patience with these
pagan superstitions. A heathen, who lives by them, cannot
let them shuffle him out of the world too quickly.
As for you, Motor Matt, you have nothing to be sorry
for. You did your best to keep the ruby out of my
hands&mdash;no one else could have done so much."</p>

<p>"It's not the ruby I care for so much as saving Tsan
Ti," answered Matt.</p>

<p>"Find out if there's a landing near this point, Pardo,"
said Grattan.</p>

<p>Pardo stepped out of the room and could be heard
talking with the man at the steering wheel.</p>

<p>"No," he reported, coming back, "there's no safe landing
for the <i>Iris</i> anywhere near here."</p>

<p>"Then put over the tender," ordered Grattan; "Motor
Matt and his friend are going ashore."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">LANDED&mdash;AND STUNG.</p>


<p>Pardo left the saloon to give the necessary orders to
the man outside. There was a splash in the water as
the tender was put over, and the <i>Iris</i> slowed until she
had no more than steerage way.</p>

<p>"Get into your clothes, McGlory," said Grattan to the
cowboy. "I'm about ready to send you ashore."</p>

<p>"The quicker the better!" exclaimed McGlory wrathfully.
"We don't want to lose a minute getting to some
place where we can send the officers after you."</p>

<p>Grattan laughed.</p>

<p>"You will have your trouble for your pains," said he.
"After you are landed, the <i>Iris</i> and those aboard her will
vanish as completely as though they had gone to the bottom.
I have planned for this. Do what you please, and
as soon as you please. Philo Grattan and his friends
will never be captured."</p>

<p>"Ten thousand demons of misfortune pester a man
who has anything to do with the Eye of Buddha," snarled
McGlory, stamping into his shoes. "My pard and I
know that. Sufferin' hoodoos! Haven't we been tangled
up with all sorts of backsets since we met Tsan Ti? If it
ain't one thing, it's two. You never know what minute's
going to be the next."</p>

<p>"I'll risk the ten thousand demons," smiled Grattan.</p>

<p>"Something'll hit you," declared McGlory. "You take
that from me, and spread your blankets on it."</p>

<p>"You forget that I have carried the ruby for a good
many thousands of miles."</p>

<p>"I'm gloomed up more to think we ever saw that Eye
of Buddha," scowled McGlory, getting up from the seat
and jamming on his hat, "than to know that we lost it."</p>

<p>"Are you ready?" asked Grattan.</p>

<p>"I've been ready to leave this boat ever since we came
aboard! You're a fine bunch of outlaws, the lot of you,
and you'll all get hung, one of these days. I'd like to be
around when it happens."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>Matt left his wrathful chum to do the talking. So far
as he was concerned, he had nothing to say.</p>

<p>"We're going to put you ashore near a place where
you can catch a train north, to Catskill," said Grattan,
after a brief, whispered conversation with Pardo. "There
doesn't happen to be any telegraph station at the place,
but the train will stop on signal."</p>

<p>"There are other telegraph stations," fumed McGlory.
"I reckon we can find 'em."</p>

<p>"I hope, Motor Matt," went on Grattan, "that you
don't cherish any hard feelings?"</p>

<p>"No matter how I feel, Grattan," returned Matt, "I
think you've made a big mistake."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"Why, in your choice of a career. Half the energy you
put into your criminal work would make you a power in
the world."</p>

<p>"I used to talk like that," said Grattan, with a tinge of
bitterness, "when I was young. Good-by."</p>

<p>Matt did not answer, but went out of the saloon and
through the stateroom to the steps leading to the after
deck. McGlory came close behind him. When they
gained the deck, Pierson was in the tender, and another
man stood ready to help them over the side.</p>

<p>Silently Pierson rowed them ashore through the moonlight.
When the boys had debarked, Pierson rowed
swiftly back to the <i>Iris</i>, and the lads on shore could hear
the noise as the tender was taken aboard.</p>

<p>"Landed," muttered Matt.</p>

<p>"And stung," finished McGlory. "Wasn't it neat?
Say, I take off my hat to Grattan. He's the king bee of
all the tinhorns. Let's watch and see which way the <i>Iris</i>
goes."</p>

<p>The boys watched, but under their staring eyes the
lights vanished one by one from forward and aft, and
from starboard and port. The cabin windows winked
out in darkness, and the gloom of the river swallowed
up the motor yacht. Her disappearance was helped by a
cloud which floated across the face of the moon and
threw the river into deepest shadow.</p>

<p>"Speak to me about that, pard!" exclaimed McGlory.
"I wonder if it would do any good to send out telegrams?"</p>

<p>"I don't think it would, Joe," Matt answered, "but if
there was a telegraph office handy, we'd try it."</p>

<p>"Let's find the place where the trains stop. If a train
comes along pretty soon, we can get to a telegraph office."</p>

<p>When the cloud had swept on, and the moon shone out
again, a survey of the place showed the boys a dark
building at the top of the bank. They climbed up to the
structure and found that it was an open shed, with
benches. There was no light, and the cowboy struck a
match and hunted for a time card. He could find none.</p>

<p>"Oh, hang such a place!" grumbled McGlory. "If we
knew how far it was to the next station, pard, we could
set out and hoof it."</p>

<p>"Haven't you done enough walking for one day, Joe?"
asked Matt. "I believe I have. I'm going to sit down
here and wait for a train to come along."</p>

<p>Suiting his action to the word, Matt dropped down on
one of the benches. His chum took a place beside him.</p>

<p>"You're as full of surprises, pard," remarked McGlory,
"as a cocoanut is of milk. There's no guessing what
you're going to do next. You didn't tell me anything
about taking the Eye of Buddha from that empty box
when you left it with the clerk, and you never let out a
yip about removing the ruby from the handkerchief and
putting it in your cap. Regular greaser trick&mdash;carrying
things in your hat."</p>

<p>"I thought I had to do something, Joe. When I was at
work in the engine room, I had planned to take off the
cap and put it in my pocket."</p>

<p>"What did you have in that handkerchief?"</p>

<p>"My pocketknife."</p>

<p>"Great guns! Was the knife in the handkerchief when
we left Catskill?"</p>

<p>"No. The knife and the handkerchief were both in
the same pocket. I managed to tie the knife up in the
handkerchief, after a fashion, while we were facing Grattan,
and he was talking."</p>

<p>"Well, glory to glory and all sashay! And Grattan
never saw you!"</p>

<p>"I'm inclined to think he did, from the way the thing
turned out."</p>

<p>"You didn't think you could fool Grattan so he
wouldn't search you, did you?"</p>

<p>"It was a desperate chance to keep him from looking
into my cap. But I might have known I couldn't fool
him."</p>

<p>Just at that moment a lantern could be seen coming
from down the track. A man reached the shed and began
lighting a lamp at each end of it.</p>

<p>"Hello, neighbor!" called McGlory. "Do you belong
around here?"</p>

<p>The man turned and looked toward the boys. Evidently
he had not seen them before, and the call startled
him.</p>

<p>"I live down the track a ways," he answered.</p>

<p>"Do you take care of this palatial depot?"</p>

<p>"I put out the lights," was the reply.</p>

<p>"A little late getting them out to-night, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"Well, no. There's no use putting them out before,
'cause the first train to stop hasn't come along yet."</p>

<p>"How far is it to Catskill?"</p>

<p>"Twenty mile."</p>

<p>"Where's the nearest telegraph office?"</p>

<p>"Three miles below. You fellers waitin' to ketch a
train for Catskill?"</p>

<p>"Yes. When will it be along?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's due now."</p>

<p>"Does it stop here?"</p>

<p>"Yes, if it's signaled."</p>

<p>"How'll we flag it?"</p>

<p>"I'll do that for ye with the lantern. That's what I
come up here for&mdash;to put out the lights an' do the flaggin'."</p>

<p>"Here's a piece of luck, anyhow, Matt," said McGlory.
"We can go on to Catskill and do our telegraphing from
there."</p>

<p>"We might just as well," said Matt.</p>

<p>Matt's failure to keep the ruby was preying on his
spirits. He couldn't help what had happened, but the
sting of failure, when he always prided himself on
"making good," was hard to bear.</p>

<p>"Buck up, pardy!" cried McGlory. "Old Tsan Ti
can't find any fault with you."</p>

<p>"I know that. I'm thinking, though, we weren't cautious
enough in going aboard that boat."</p>

<p>"Cautious? Tell me about that! Who wouldn't have
been fooled, when the game was worked like Grattan
worked it? I don't know how any one could have helped
what happened."</p>

<p>"Anyhow," said Matt, "we fell down. It might have
been just as well if I had disobeyed Tsan Ti's instructions
and placed the ruby in some bank vault."</p>

<p>"But the mandarin said no. You carried out orders to
the letter, and that's what lost us the ruby."</p>

<p>"We were to stay in the Catskills, and we didn't. Because
we broke over our instructions, we fell into the
hands of Grattan."</p>

<p>"He'd have got at you somehow even if we'd stayed
in Catskill. I never saw such a man to keep after a thing
he's set his mind on. Now, if we&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Train's comin'," called the man, stepping upon the
track and waving the lantern.</p>

<p>The rumble of the passenger could be heard, growing
rapidly in volume.</p>

<p>"Well," remarked McGlory, as he and Matt got up,
"we've shuffled off the hoodoo and nothing more will go
crossways with us. That's worth a whole lot. And if
Tsan Ti is fool enough to choke himself with that yellow
cord, well, let him do it. Grattan was more than half
right in what he said about that."</p>

<p>The train, with its row of dimly lighted windows, came
to a halt. Matt and McGlory climbed aboard, and the
train started on again.</p>

<p>The boys walked from one car into another trying to
find a vacant seat which they could share together. At
last Matt, who was in the lead, came to a halt in the aisle
at the rear of the second coach.</p>

<p>"Move on, pard," said McGlory. "We'll try the next
car. It can't be that all the coaches are as full as this
one."</p>

<p>But Matt did not move on. He turned, amazement
shining in his gray eyes, and pointed to a seat ahead of
him, and on the right.</p>

<p>Two drowsy Chinamen occupied the seat. One of
them was fleshy, and took up two-thirds of the space.
This man wore a black silk cap with a red button. His
chin was sunk on his breast and he was snoring loudly.</p>

<p>"Tsan Ti!" murmured McGlory, wondering if his eyes
were playing him a trick.</p>

<p>"And Sam Wing," added Matt. "The mandarin is
going to Catskill to get the ruby. Here's where I have
to tell him the truth."</p>

<p>With that, Motor Matt leaned over and touched Tsan
Ti on the shoulder.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">A CRAFTY ORIENTAL.</p>


<p>Meeting Tsan Ti in this peculiar fashion was a seven-day
wonder to the motor boys. The workings of chance,
in connection with various matters appertaining to the
stolen ruby, could not have been better exemplified.</p>

<p>Tsan Ti roused himself under Matt's touch, and blinked
up at him through sleepy eyes. By degrees the lad's face
took form before him, and he gave an incredulous grunt
and floundered to his feet.</p>

<p>"Estimable, never-to-be-forgotten friend!" the mandarin
wheezed, his flabby face beaming as he reached for
Motor Matt's hand. "Also the notable McGlory, friend
of my friend! This is a delight, all the more joyful because
not expected until Catskill. Why is it I have the
great honor to see you here?"</p>

<p>"That's quite a yarn, Tsan Ti," replied Matt.</p>

<p>"Let me hear it forthwith, I beseech!" and Tsan Ti
ordered Sam Wing out of the seat and motioned for
Matt to take his place.</p>

<p>The mandarin had been educated at one of the most
famous colleges in the United States, and seemed, as McGlory
expressed it, to have spent most of his time corralling
adjectives.</p>

<p>Sam Wing, apparently not in the least excited by the
sudden appearance of the motor boys, got a seat across
the aisle and continued his doze. McGlory managed to
secure a place behind Matt.</p>

<p>"I, most devoted youth," said Tsan Ti, as soon as Matt
was seated, "am on my way to Catskill of a purpose to
talk with you. No longer am I followed by the suspicious
person whom I know to have been in the service of Grattan.
So soon as I discovered this, I started immediately
to find you. The five hundred gods of good luck must
have decreed this meeting."</p>

<p>"Rather," answered Matt, "the ten thousand demons of
misfortune. I suppose, Tsan Ti, you are after the Eye of
Buddha?"</p>

<p>"Quite true, honorable youth."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well," said Matt, "I haven't got it."</p>

<p>Tsan Ti started, then slumped back into his seat.</p>

<p>"It has escaped you, vigilant one?" he inquired, his
puffy eyelids half closing as he regarded Matt.</p>

<p>"It has escaped me, all right."</p>

<p>"And who has it now?"</p>

<p>"Grattan."</p>

<p>The mandarin turned his face away and looked out of
the car window into the night. Motor Matt felt miserable
enough. His words, just uttered, might have sealed
the doom of the mandarin.</p>

<p>"Converse with me at length upon the subject," said
Tsan Ti, again turning toward Matt. "What you say is
of vast importance, excellent friend."</p>

<p>Matt had twenty miles of slow traveling in which to
make his disclosures, and he made them in detail, with
now and then an explanatory word from McGlory.</p>

<p>He began at the point where he had received the ruby,
and set forth the manner in which Bunce had presented
himself. Bunce's cock-and-bull story was gone into, and
Tsan Ti's eyes twinkled humorously&mdash;Matt wondered at
the humor&mdash;as he heard how he had been lured into a
basement by a beach comber and was being held a prisoner.
The leaving of the box with the hotel clerk, the
flight into the hills, and the disappearance of Bunce, all
dropped into the recital in chronological form; then came
the tracking to the "pocket" under the ledge, and the following
of the motorcycle trails in the direction of Catskill,
the arrival of the boys in town, and the report of the clerk
concerning the forged letter and the removal of the box.</p>

<p>"So there," put in the mandarin, "is where my ruby
escaped from your unfortunate hands."</p>

<p>"Don't be so quick in your snap judgments, Tsan,"
spoke up McGlory. "The ruby wasn't in the box, but in
Motor Matt's pocket. My pard had left the empty box
with the clerk for a bluff."</p>

<p>The mandarin chuckled, and his body shook with his
suppressed mirth.</p>

<p>"Remarkably well planned!" approved Tsan Ti. "Who
could have done better? You have a brain of great
power, my renowned friend, and your talk gives me much
amusement and instruction. Grattan had the empty box
and you had the ruby. What then?"</p>

<p>Then followed the call at the hotel of the man from the
<i>Iris</i>, and Matt's agreement to take charge of the yacht's
motor on the down-river trip, Matt to return to Catskill
on the following morning. The treachery aboard the
boat was listened to by the mandarin with flashing eyes.</p>

<p>"Grattan is possessed of a demon," declared Tsan Ti.
"His wits are as keen as a sword's edge, and he knows
how to use them. I do not wonder, estimable friend, that
you fell into his power. Even I, had I been in your place,
could not have saved the jewel."</p>

<p>"What's to be done now, Tsan Ti?" asked Matt anxiously.</p>

<p>"Nothing," was the answer.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but&mdash;the yellow cord!"</p>

<p>"It shall not be used by me."</p>

<p>Here was a mystery. If Tsan Ti could not bear the
Eye of Buddha back to the Canton temple, it was the
august decree of the regent that he should perish by the
yellow cord. The ruby had been recovered, and lost
again, but Tsan Ti had no intention of strangling himself
by invitation of his ruler.</p>

<p>Failing to understand this point, Matt shifted the subject.</p>

<p>"Did you know, Tsan Ti," he queried, "that while you
were in New York you had a Chinese spy around with
you? A man who was carrying news of everything you
did to an agent of Grattan's?"</p>

<p>"You refer to Charley Foo, honorable one?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Grattan can plan, my son, and so can the mandarin.
This agent of Grattan paid Charley Foo ten silver dollars
to betray me, and Charley Foo told me of it, showed the
money, and asked what it was I would have him tell this
hireling of Grattan's. Charley Foo was of much help
to me."</p>

<p>Tsan Ti folded his hands complacently over his capacious
stomach.</p>

<p>"Well, sufferin' bluffs!" murmured McGlory. "Charley
Foo was the kind of a dark horse they were playing both
ways. He told Grattan's man only what Tsan Ti wanted
him to know; then why, in the name of all that's hard to
figure out, did Tsan tell Charley to let it be known that
the ruby was being sent to Motor Matt?"</p>

<p>"It was my wish that Grattan should know about the
sending of the ruby," said this most amazing Chinaman.</p>

<p>"Then," went on McGlory, "you expected that Grattan
would get on Motor Matt's trail and make a dead set to
get back the Eye of Buddha."</p>

<p>"I thought it most likely, sagacious youth."</p>

<p>"Then," averred McGlory warmly, "you can't blame
Motor Matt for losing the ruby."</p>

<p>"Am I blaming him, inconsiderate one?" returned Tsan
Ti. "Have I said one scolding word, or emitted anything
but praise? Motor Matt has done excellently well, and
I shall engrave his deeds on the tablets of my memory."</p>

<p>"But the ruby is gone!" said Matt.</p>

<p>"Not so, highly esteemed but most deceived friend.
Observe!"</p>

<p>With that, Tsan Ti opened his yellow silk blouse and
revealed a small bag suspended by a chain from his neck.
Opening the bag, he gave Matt and McGlory a swift
glimpse of a shining, blood-red jewel.</p>

<p>"Behold the Eye of Buddha," smiled the mandarin.
"Not Grattan, with all his evil work, has it, but I."</p>

<p>This, as might be expected, heaped up the measure of
astonishing events and topped off the motor boys' bewilderment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>"But the ruby&mdash;the Eye of Buddha Grattan took from
me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That, generous youth," answered the mandarin, dropping
the bag on his breast and rearranging his blouse,
"was not a ruby, but a base replica of the true gem. It is
worth, possibly, five dollars. I secured it from a stonecutter
in New York."</p>

<p>By degrees the mandarin's crafty performance dawned
on the motor boys. They were awed by the scope and
audacious success of the design&mdash;completely fooling Grattan
as it had done. As a specimen of Oriental craft, it
was a revelation to Matt and McGlory.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">THE MANDARIN WINS.</p>


<p>"Listen, honorable friends," said Tsan Ti, "while I
talk to you instructively. In the words of the great Confucius,
'the cautious man seldom errs.' When I departed
from you, amiable ones, on recovering the Eye of Buddha,
I said that I was returning to my country by way of San
Francisco. Such was my intention, of the moment, but
further reflection dissuaded me. I decided to go to New
York and proceed to China by the longer, but perhaps the
safer, way.</p>

<p>"In the great city I discovered that I was being pursued
and spied upon, and a great fear overcame me. Immediately
I thought of Motor Matt. Should I visit him
with possible dangers, I besought of myself, in order that
I might preserve the precious relic from the temple at
Honam? I thought of your bravery, never sufficiently to
be praised, and I decided to make the risk. The cutter of
precious stones was sent for, and I showed my ruby and
asked that he make a counterfeit of it that would deceive
any but a dealer in jewels. This was done, and quickly.
I sent this comparatively valueless replica to you, Motor
Matt, and told Charley Foo to let Grattan's man know
what I had done. Also, the man was to be informed of
my desire that Motor Matt should carry the stone about
with him continually.</p>

<p>"What would happen? I inquired of myself. Most
certainly, reflection made answer. Grattan will be upon
the brave youth's track, and he will never rest until he
secures the gem. This is as I desired, although I dared
not so express myself in my letter which accompanied
the false gem.</p>

<p>"After the package had left me, my heart failed. I
feared I had exposed you to dangers which might cause
your undoing. Hence, without lingering further, Sam
Wing and I took this train for Catskill, I being of the
intention to tell you what I had planned, and to let it be
known, through Charley Foo, that the real gem was in
my hands and not yours.</p>

<p>"And see, I have come too late. Grattan, the wise and
unscrupulous, has taken the counterfeit ruby and is
pleased to think he has cheated me, and that I shall pass
by means of the yellow cord. All is well, and my plans
are maturing most successfully. The five hundred gods
of good fortune are smiling upon me. While Grattan
goes his course, firmly believing he has the Eye of
Buddha, I travel mine, knowing he has been justly deceived."</p>

<p>There was a little resentment in Matt's heart as he
listened to the mandarin's explanation of his crafty ways
and means for circumventing Grattan. Tsan Ti had
thrown upon Matt the weight of the whole proceeding,
and had not taken means to inform him of the true state
of affairs. The king of the motor boys, had he understood
the nature of the mandarin's scheme, could have
worked out his part of it even more successfully than he
had done while being kept in ignorance.</p>

<p>"You're a keen one, Tsan," grunted McGlory, "but I'm
a Piute if I admire the free-and-easy fashion you have of
making dupes of your friends."</p>

<p>"It is that which has pained me," admitted the mandarin,
"and it is my regret which was carrying me speedily
to Catskill to tell my widely known friend the exact
truth. Fate was quicker in the race than I. Events have
come swiftly to pass, and out of them rises Grattan with
the false ruby. I have been fortunate, and while he goes
to parts unknown, I shall hope to reach China before he
discovers his error."</p>

<p>"Queer that Grattan, who knows the great ruby so
well," said Matt, "could be fooled with a piece of glass
of the same shape and size."</p>

<p>"And likewise of the exact color," returned Tsan Ti.
"The color was most important of all. That Grattan was
fooled shows how admirably the cutter of precious stones
has done his work."</p>

<p>"You're really going to China this time, are you, Tsan
Ti?"</p>

<p>"Of a certainty," declared the mandarin. "Now that
you have been met most wonderfully on this train, I shall
not get off at Catskill, but will accompany the cars to
Buffalo. From there, without delay, I shall go on to
Chicago, from there to Denver, and so to San Francisco,
where I will embark on the first ship that will carry me
across the Pacific."</p>

<p>Tsan Ti leaned over in front of Matt and called out
something in Chinese to Sam Wing. Sam Wing lifted
his nodding head with a start, and from his blouse produced
a small sack of alligator skin, which he handed to
his master.</p>

<p>The sack was stuffed with banknotes, and from the lot
the mandarin extracted three five-hundred-dollar bills.</p>

<p>"Will you consider it of an insulting nature if I offer
you these?" inquired the mandarin of Matt.</p>

<p>"I won't, if he does," chimed in McGlory.</p>

<p>"I think I'm entitled to the money, Tsan Ti," said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
Matt. "The way you Chinamen do business doesn't
make much of a hit with me. Your little plot wouldn't
have been hurt in the least if you had just mentioned in
the letter you sent with that supposed ruby that the gem
was false, and that you sent it to me hoping Grattan
would get it and keep off your trail. I could have helped
you even more in achieving your purpose."</p>

<p>"It is to be regretted deeply that I did not," answered
the mandarin humbly. "In my own country I would not
have given two thoughts to the troubles I caused another,
so long as my aim was just and wise; but here, in
America, different standards rule, and that I brought
dangers upon your head I shall never forget."</p>

<p>The door of the coach opened and a brakeman thrust in
his head to call out the station of Catskill.</p>

<p>"That means us, pard," said McGlory. "Grab your
money and let's hike."</p>

<p>Matt took the money and slowly placed it in his pocket.</p>

<p>"You bear no ill will, worthy one, and friend whose
memory will always blossom in the gardens of my recollections?"
asked Tsan Ti.</p>

<p>"It's all right, Tsan Ti," returned Matt, getting up.
"You win, and are off for the Flowery Kingdom with
the Eye of Buddha. Grattan loses, and he'll find it out
sooner or later. As for Joe and me, we'll call accounts
square. Good-by, and good luck to you." He took the
mandarin's hand cordially.</p>

<p>"May the five hundred gods of good luck smile continually
upon you," said Tsan Ti.</p>

<p>With that, Motor Matt and McGlory left the coach and
dropped off the train.</p>

<p>"Back in Catskill!" said the cowboy, "and after being
fooled by Bunce, and Grattan, and Tsan Ti!"</p>

<p>"We've fooled Grattan twice where he has fooled us
once, Joe," returned Matt.</p>

<p>"Right you are, pard; and there's plenty of chance for
Tsan Ti to run into a snag between here and China."</p>

<p>"I'm hoping he makes the trip without any trouble."</p>

<p>"I don't know but I hope the same thing, although I
get a trifle hot under the collar every time I think of the
way we fretted over a piece of colored glass."</p>

<p>They stood on the platform until the tail lights of the
train had vanished from sight up the track.</p>

<p>"The mandarin is getting a good start on the home
trail, anyhow," remarked McGlory, as he and Matt turned
away to climb the slope that led to their hotel. "He's
bound west by train, while Grattan is fooling around,
somewhere on the Hudson, with the <i>Iris</i>. I wouldn't
turn over my hand, after what Tsan Ti told us, to put the
kibosh on Grattan, or even Bunce."</p>

<p>"Grattan and Bunce have got their deserts," asserted
Matt. "They'll be punished enough when they discover
that they've had all their trouble and taken so many
chances for nothing more than a bogus ruby."</p>

<p>"Fine business," chuckled McGlory; "and yet," he
added, with a perceptible change in his voice, "there's
something about that Philo Grattan that makes a hit with
me. Maybe I've got a yellow streak in my make-up,
somewhere, and that it's wrong for me to own up to such
a notion, but it's the truth."</p>

<p>"If Grattan was honest," said Matt, "he'd be a fellow
any one could like. But his ideas are all wrong. He
can't see where the harm comes in removing a valuable
ruby from an idol in a heathen temple, but if he'd step
into Tiffany's, in New York, and extract a gem like that
from the show case and make off with it, his crime
wouldn't be any the less."</p>

<p>"A heathen has got property rights," agreed the cowboy,
"just the same as you or me&mdash;or Grattan, himself.
Where do you suppose Grattan, and that choice assortment
of tinhorns he has with him on the <i>Iris</i>, are going?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, pard, and what happens to them now
doesn't bother me much. We're rid of them all, and I'm
thankful for it. We've had too much of Tsan Ti, as well
as of Grattan and Bunce."</p>

<p>"That's what you say now, but just let the mandarin
write you one of those embroidered letters of his, asking
for help, and you'll head in his direction just a-smoking."</p>

<p>"Not again, Joe. I know what the Yellow Peril is,
now, and I'm going to fight shy of it."</p>

<p>"Amen to that, pard, and I hope you stick to it."</p>

<p>"I will."</p>

<p>"And there's nothing more between us and a high old
time in Manhattan?"</p>

<p>"Nothing but a stretch of river&mdash;or of railroad track,
Joe, if you'd rather go by train."</p>

<p>"Hooray!" jubilated McGlory.</p>

<h2><a name="JERRY_STEBBINS_HOSS_TRADE" id="JERRY_STEBBINS_HOSS_TRADE">JERRY STEBBINS' HOSS TRADE.</a></h2>


<p>At a recent interview with one Jeremiah Stebbins, he freed
his mind in the following choice language:</p>

<p>"Everybody I've saw lately has ben a-winking and a-smirking,
and a-laughing, and a-saying, 'How de dew, Jerry? how's
the hoss trade?' and sich like, and I've got tired on't; and I'm
a going to tell the hull story to you newspaper fellers, and let
you print it and done with it.</p>

<p>"You see, the way on't was this. I live up in Bucks
County, Pennsylvania, and once in a while I takes a trip
down to Philadelphia to see the sights, do some dickering,
buy some store things, and so on.</p>

<p>"I've al'ays considered myself pooty cute, and have gi'n
lots o' advice to them that's around me, telling 'em about the
city, and its big shows, and its cheating scamps, and what to
do when they goes there, and how not to get took in, and
all sich; and I 'spect it's jest because I've done all this ere
that the laugh comes in agin me pooty rough-like.</p>

<p>"You see there's a feller living right nigh me, named Jim
Smithers, who's been down to Philadelphia four times, and
every time so'thing's happened to him in the way o' getting
fooled by some o' them confounded scamps what don't 'pear
to do nothing for a living but lay around, like nasty spiders,
watching for flies, to ketch some o' us country chaps by some
dirty trick or other, and git hold o' some o' our hard-earned
dollars to loaf around on. I ain't afeared to speak my mind
about 'em, and I don't keer a goll darn if you print it, nuther,
and let 'em know that I think they're just about as mean as
mean kin be.</p>

<p>"Waal, about Jim Smithers. He's pooty green yit; but the
first time he went down to the big city he was as raw as a
new cabbage, and he got took in fifteen dollars' worth on
what you newspaper fellers calls the drap game.</p>

<p>"In course you know all about that ere. A feller comes up
behind the country chap, and, all unbeknown to him, drops
a pocketbook, picks it up, and tells him it's hisn. But it ain't,
you know, and the country feller says so. Then the city
scamp opens it a lettle, and it 'pears to be stuffed full o'
bank bills; and he says it's a pity that some honest man has
got to lose it, 'cause he hisself's a stranger in town, and is
jest a-going out ag'in, and he can't stop to advertise it, and
git the big reward that's sartin to be offered for it; but if
the country feller's a mind to take it, give him fifteen or
twenty dollars or so, he'll let him have his chance, and so on.</p>

<p>"Waal, Jim Smithers was ketched in this way, and he gin
the other feller fifteen dollars&mdash;nigh all the money he had&mdash;and
when he went to put so'thing into the <i>Public Ledger</i>
about it, and handed over one o' the bills to pay for 't, the
grinning clerk told him as how he'd ben 'sold,' and the money
wa'n't wo'th as much as white paper. Wa'n't Jim mad, then?
and didn't us fellers plague him peskily about it arter he got
home?</p>

<p>"Waal, the next time Jim went to the city he got ketched in
some keerd trick, and lost a twenty-dollar bill afore he
knowed it. The third time he spent five dollars, a-buying
prize packages that didn't have no prizes in 'em 'cept brass
rings; and the last time some scamp ketched him ag'in on a
hoss affair.</p>

<p>"'Jim Smithers,' says I, arter he'd told me all about it,
'if I's you I wouldn't go down to Philadelphia ag'in alone&mdash;I
swon I wouldn't. Jest as like as not some critter, a-running
loose in the streets, will take you fer a green pumpkin, and
eat you all right up, so's you won't never git back to your
mar any more,' says I.</p>

<p>"'Oh, you think your darn smart, Jerry Stebbins, don't
ye?' says Jim back ag'in. 'Jest you look out that you don't
git ketched some day your own self.'</p>

<p>"'They've all tried me, and found me too smart for 'em,'
says I.</p>

<p>"'We'll see in the end,' says Jim.</p>

<p>"'Bout a week or so arter that, I went down ag'in to
Philadelphia. I had some arrants to do for some o' my
neighbors; and I'd a notion to tend a auction sale of hosses,
and if I could see any going right cheap, I thought mebbe I
might buy one on a spec&mdash;for, though I says it myself, I'm
pooty cute in a hoss trade, and have made a good many dollars
afore now in fatting up some old critter and then swapping
him off and gitting boot.</p>

<p>"Waal, I went to town, and, arter gitting through with my
other business, I started right over to the bazaar, where they
sells hosses&mdash;for I'd been there afore and knowed exactly
where it was.</p>

<p>"Jest as I was a-going in, I met a dressy-looking chap
a-coming out; and he says to me, says he:</p>

<p>"'Mister, kin you tell me where I kin buy a right good
hoss pooty cheap?'</p>

<p>"'I couldn't, less it's in here,' says I 'for that's jest what
I wants to do myself.'</p>

<p>"'Waal, I shan't buy in this here cheating place,' says he,
'for I done that once afore, and paid a hundred dollars for a
critter that I arterward had to sell for thirty-five; and right
glad I was to git that much, and only lose sixty-five on the
trade. If I's you I wouldn't risk no money in here.'</p>

<p>"'I knows a hoss when I sees him,' says I, pooty proud,
feeling my oats, 'and if anybody makes anything off o' Jerry
Stebbins in a hoss trade, I hope they'll let me know.'</p>

<p>"'S'pose you could pick out a good nice critter for me, Mr.
Stebbins, and not get cheated in the price?' says he.</p>

<p>"'I s'pose I could if I'd try,' says I.</p>

<p>"'And would five dollars make you try?' says he.</p>

<p>"'I guess it would,' says I.</p>

<p>"'Wal, then,' says he, 'I'll give you a five-dollar bill to do
it,' says he.</p>

<p>"He rammed his hand into his pocket to git the money;
but afore he'd drawed it out, a slick-looking feller comes
riding up on hossback, and says to my chap, says he:</p>

<p>"'Do you know anybody what wants to buy a right good
hoss dirt cheap?'</p>

<p>"'I dew,' says my man.</p>

<p>"'How high be you willing to go?' says the hossback chap.</p>

<p>"'I don't keer a darn, so's the critter's wo'th the money,'
says t'other, and he gin me a sly wink.</p>

<p>"'Then I'll take you to a place where I know you'll be
suited,' says the hossback chap.</p>

<p>"'Fur from here?' axes t'other.</p>

<p>"'Not more'n a mile at the outside,' says him on the hoss.</p>

<p>"'Will you jest go along, 'arn the five, and see that I ain't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
cheated?' says the foot feller to me, in a tone so low that
t'other couldn't hear.</p>

<p>"I said I would; and then my man axed the man on the
hoss for his keerd, which he gin him and rid away.</p>

<p>"While we was a-going to the place, my feller told me that
his name was John Jenkins; that he'd got as much money
as he keerd about having, and if he could only git a hoss to
suit him, and not pay more for't than 'twas wo'th, he'd be
mighty pleased.</p>

<p>"''Tain't 'cause I ker a darn for the money, Mr. Stebbins,'
says he to me, confiding-like; 'but it's 'cause I knows as how
all these racehoss-jockey fellers takes a pride in gitting the
best of everybody they deals with, and I hates to be beat in
that are way. Now I sees by your eyes, Mr. Stebbins, that
you ain't a chap to be took in in a hoss trade, and I wants
you to use 'em for me; and if things comes out all right, I
won't stop to put another ten or twenty a-top of the five, you
know.'</p>

<p>"'I'll do my best, Mr. Jenkins,' says I; 'and I guess you'll
find my best right up to the handle.'</p>

<p>"When we got to the place we seen a stable, in a little,
back, dirty street, and in it was two men and three hosses.</p>

<p>"Two of these 'ere hosses wan't o' no great account, but
t'other one was a pooty slick smart-looking critter.</p>

<p>"'How much for this 'ere one?' says Mr. Jenkins, putting
his hand onto the beast.</p>

<p>"Waal, really,' says the dealer, 'we don't keer about selling
that are critter.'</p>

<p>"'I was recommended to come here for a place where I
could buy a good hoss cheap,' says Mr. Jenkins.</p>

<p>"'We really hain't got nothing to sell 'cept the other two
critters,' says the jockey. 'We'll sell you them cheap.'</p>

<p>"'I don't want 'em,' says Jenkins, 'but only this 'ere one.
Hey, Stebbins! what d'you say?' he says, speaking to me.</p>

<p>"'Waal, the critter you've picked out is pooty likely,' says
I, 'but I don't think much of t'others.'</p>

<p>"He called me out one side, and axed me what the best
hoss was really wo'th.</p>

<p>"'A good hundred and twenty-five,' says I.</p>

<p>"'How about a hundred and fifty?' says he.</p>

<p>"'I wouldn't go a mite over a hundred and forty,' says I.</p>

<p>"'I'll have him, though, at some price, for I've sot my mind
on't,' says he, in a determined way.</p>

<p>"Then he went back to the jockey, and offered him a hundred
dollars for that critter.</p>

<p>"The jockey chap laughed right in his face at fust, and
then he 'peared to get mad, and said, says he:</p>

<p>"'You're either a dealer yourself, or else you wants to
insult me; and no matter which it are, I ain't a-going to trade
with you at no price.'</p>

<p>"'I'll give you a hundred and twenty-five,' says Jenkins.</p>

<p>"'Pshaw!' says jockey.</p>

<p>"'A hundred and fifty,' says Jenkins.</p>

<p>"'No,' says t'other.</p>

<p>"'A hundred and seventy-five, then.'</p>

<p>"'No.'</p>

<p>"'I'll give you two hundred.'</p>

<p>"'You can't buy him at no price,' says the hoss dealer,
looking awful mad.</p>

<p>"'Then let us go to a more decenter place, Mr. Stebbins,'
says Jenkins to me.</p>

<p>"We started off together, and as soon as we'd got out of
sight of the stable, Jenkins says to me, says he:</p>

<p>"'Friend Stebbins, I wants that are hoss right bad, 'cause
he's jest the critter to suit me. I wonder if you couldn't buy
him for me?'</p>

<p>"'I don't 'spect I could,' says I, 'for the feller that owns
him has got his Dutch up, and won't sell him to neither of
us.'</p>

<p>"'Would you mind going back by yourself and trying?' says
he.</p>

<p>"'To obleege you I'll dew it,' says I. 'But the hoss ain't
wo'th what you offered, and nothink like it.'</p>

<p>"'I don't keer for that, Mr. Stebbins,' says he; 'it a'nt making
a spec' I'm arter; I wants the hoss for hisself, 'cause
I've sot my mind on't, and money ain't no object with me.
I'll tell ye what I'll dew. If you'll buy that are hoss and fetch
him round to my stable, I'll jest plank down two hundred and
fifty dollars cash for him, and you may make what profit you
kin. I don't keer what you give for him, but I'll give you
two hundred and fifty dollars jest the minute he reaches my
stable, and I'll go right down there now and wait for you.'</p>

<p>"I told him I'd try my luck, and he writ down the direction
for me to come to.</p>

<p>"Waal, I went back and found the two hoss fellers talking
with the chap that had fust told us about the place.</p>

<p>"The minute this chap seen me, he come for'ard and said
he was right down sorry that his pardners had got mad at
my friend&mdash;and if he'd been there it wouldn't have turned
out so&mdash;though it was a insult for him to offer only a hundred
dollars for a hoss like that are, which nobody could find
his match nowhere for a cent less than three hundred dollars
in gold.</p>

<p>"'Tell you what 'tis, mister,' he says, 'I know your friend,
John Jenkins&mdash;though he don't recollect me&mdash;and I know he's
mighty rich, and a right down good customer where he likes
to deal, and I hate like fury that he went away disapp'inted.
Now if you'll find him, and fetch him back, and git him to
trade with us, I'll give you a five-dollar bill.'</p>

<p>"I thought I'd got a good chance for a spec, so I says,
says I:</p>

<p>"'I don't think I could git him back; but if you folks here
wants to sell that are hoss, and will take what he's wo'th, I
don't mind buying him for my own self.'</p>

<p>"'You kin have him for two hundred and twenty-five dollars,
and not a cent short,' says he.</p>

<p>"'That's more'n I'd give my old daddy for him,' says I.</p>

<p>"Then we began to talk, and palaver, and hile, and at last
I got him down to two hundred and ten, and him to give in
a old saddle and bridle, so's I could ride him off.</p>

<p>"Waal, I paid down the money, and then rode off for
Jenkins' stable feeling pooty proud and happy that I'd
made a clean forty dollars by my barg'in.</p>

<p>"But, somehow or other, I couldn't find Jenkins' stable,
nor Jenkins nuther, and I hain't found 'em since.</p>

<p>"To git right down to the gist on't, I'd been awfully fooled,
and tricked into paying two hundred and ten dollars for a
hoss that I didn't want myself, and that I's glad to git rid on,
arterwards for one hundred and five, jest one-half the critter
cost me.</p>

<p>"Waal, mister, that's the story that all the folks round my
way is a-grinning and a-snickering over, and I s'pose I've got
to grin and bear it till the hull darned thing dies out and be
darned to it.</p>

<p>"It's l'arned me for one thing, that them slick-looking,
slick-talking city fellers kin lie and cheat like thunder; and
for another thing, that it don't dew for a country chap to
butt his brains ag'in them city scamps and al'ays 'spect to git
the best on't."</p>

<p>"Whenever I tell the story," said Alf Whitney, throwing
away his half-smoked cigar, and putting his long legs on the
top of the table, in a way some men have when a story is to
be forthcoming, "everybody winks at everybody else, as much
as to say, 'Alf had taken too much whisky that time,' or 'Alf
was asleep and dreamed the whole thing.' But I tell you,
comrades, though you are at liberty to disbelieve what I tell
you, it is true; and that's all I know about it. I'm no long-headed
metaphysician to reason it all out&mdash;I only know what
happened, and it's that I'm going to tell."</p>

<p>We gathered closer around the red-hot stove in the bar-room<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
of the Anderson House, for it was a biting cold night,
and the snow was too much for our train, destitute as we
were of a snowplow, and we had given up the attempt to
push through to C&mdash;&mdash; that night, and retaken ourselves to
the hospitalities of the Arlington.</p>

<p>It had often been whispered among the railway employees
that Alf Whitney had once had something strange happen to
him. He was a young man yet, though the oldest and most
skillful engineer on the road&mdash;noted for his skill and judgment,
no less than for his sturdy endurance and his bravery,
which nothing ever overcame.</p>

<p>I suppose you people who ride in Pullman cars, rocked in
velvet cushions, and look at the scenery rushing past,
through plate glass windows, heavy with gilt and rosewood
mouldings, never think much of the man upon whom your
safety depends&mdash;the man who, with his hand upon the lever
which controls the monster that is bearing you along, stands
tireless at his post, through cold and heat, through storm
and sunshine, smutty, grimy with smoke, greasy and weather-hardened,
but oftentimes the bravest and noblest man among
you all. But this is a digression.</p>

<p>We all hastened to assure Alf that we were ready to believe
whatever he might say; and he, smiling a little, as if he
doubted the sincerity of our assurances, began his story. I
give it in his own words, which are much better than mine
would be.</p>

<p>"Six years ago, one dark stormy night, Jack Horton lost
his life in a smash-up at Rowley's Bend. Jack was an engineer,
and as fine a fellow as ever trod the ground. He was
handsome, too, and notwithstanding his dirty occupation, a
great favorite with the ladies; for when he was off the machine
long enough to get the oil and cinders washed off, and
his other clothes on, he was the best-looking, as well as the
best-mannered, young man anywhere in this vicinity.</p>

<p>"He was engaged to marry Esther Clay; and Esther was a
beauty without anything by way of art to help her&mdash;a sound-looking,
wholesome, healthy young girl&mdash;none of your die-away
kind, fainting at the sight of a spider, and going into
tantrums over a cow a mile off. She was just the kind of
woman I could worship, and not put myself out any to do it,
either!"</p>

<p>"Why didn't you go for her after Jack was dead?" asked
Tom Barnard carelessly.</p>

<p>"Hush! she is dead!" said Alf, in a subdued voice; and
the unwonted pallor that settled round his mouth gave me a
slight clue to the reason he had never married. And afterward
I knew that Esther Clay, dead, and pledged through
all eternity to another, was more to him than any living
woman!</p>

<p>After a little he went on.</p>

<p>"When Jack was killed, it was the breaking of an axle that
caused the mischief; and, of course, this axle broke on just
the worst part of the road. They always do. You all know
Rowley's Bend? You all know just how high the grade is
there, and just how rough and jagged the rocks lie all along
the embankment, clear down to the river. No need to dwell
on this. The train pitched down into the dark, head first,
and Jack, true to his duty, never stirred from his post. It
was a good while before we could get to him, the broken
timbers of the piled-up cars so completely caged him in. She
came there before we had taken his body out, and I shall
never forget how she went down into the ruins where even
the bravest of us hardly dared to venture, so insecure was
the footing, and worked with her white, slender hands, until
the blood ran from their wounds. She never minded it a
particle, but worked on, with a face as pale and rigid as
marble. But I am making a long story, and dwelling too
much on details. Jack was dead when they found him, and
she lived just a month afterward. And, though everybody
lamented at her funeral, and said it was 'so sad,' I do not
think it was sad, for when two people love each other, truly
and loyally, and one of them dies, it seems to me Heaven's
special mercy if the other is suffered to go along.</p>

<p>"Jack and I had always been great friends; and once when
we were talking about the supernatural nonsense that so
many believe in, Jack said to me laughingly:</p>

<p>"'If I die first, I'll keep a watch over you, old fellow; and
when I see you running into danger, I'll whistle the brakes
down. Now remember!' After he died these careless words
of his kept coming back to me, and try as I would not to
remember them, the more they were present to my mind.</p>

<p>"It was nearly two years after Jack's death that I was
taking the ten-fifty accommodation out to L&mdash;&mdash;. It was
a dark, drizzly night, and the headlight on the front of the
engine pierced but a short distance into the gloom and fog
ahead of us. I was running carefully, as I always run on
such nights, and had nearly reached Carney's Ford when I
saw something on the track before us. I whistled to down
brakes, and reversed the lever. The train slackened, and I
could see distinctly ahead of us the tall figure of a man. But
we got no nearer to him, for though he seemed to be only
walking, his speed was fully equal to ours. We should never
overtake him. A cold shiver ran through me as I noted this
fact. No mortal man could walk like that.</p>

<p>"'Richards,' said I to the fireman, who, ghastly and trembling
with fear, was gazing at the strange apparition, 'it must
be Old Nick himself, with the seven-league boots on!'</p>

<p>"As I spoke, the figure turned toward us, and then I saw
that in his hand he carried a red lantern, the well-known
signal of danger. He lifted it, swung it slowly round his
head once, and, as he did so, the blood-red light fell full on
his face&mdash;the face of Jack Horton. For a moment he stood
motionless, then he was enveloped in a pale, azure flame,
which died out instantly, and left&mdash;nothing!</p>

<p>"All this, which it has taken me so long to describe, took
place in an instant of time, and by the time the phantom had
vanished Richards and I had managed to stop the train. We
got off and went ahead. The red lantern had not signaled
'danger' for nothing. A heavy stick of timber was spiked
across the track, and, had we gone on at full speed, it would
have sent us to swift destruction.</p>

<p>"The company ferreted out the rascal who had done this
vile thing, and he is serving out a long term in the State
prison now. I have seen him and talked with him, and he
swore to me, with a voice that trembled even then with horror,
that after he had spiked down the timber and had hidden
in some bushes near by to watch the result, he had seen a
tall man, with a red lantern in his hand, start up in front of
the engine and walk, as nothing human could walk, until he
reached the very spot where the danger lay.</p>

<p>"'And then,' said the miscreant, 'he changed into a blue
flame, and vanished, and I knew that my plan was upset, and
that for once Satan had gone back on them as he'd set to
work.'"</p>

<p>"Well," said Tom Barnard, "what else?"</p>

<p>"That is all," said Alf, lighting another cigar.</p>

<p>"But what was the fellow's object in seeking to disable the
train?"</p>

<p>"Plunder. He had ascertained that a carrying company
would have a large sum of money on board that night, and he
was not averse to turning an honest penny."</p>

<p>"But the phantom&mdash;how do you explain it?" persisted Tom.</p>

<p>"I don't explain it," said Alf quietly.</p>

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your

Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the

1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
